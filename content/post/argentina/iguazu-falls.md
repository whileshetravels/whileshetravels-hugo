Iguazu falls are waterfalls of the Iguazu River on the border of the Argentine province of Misiones and the Brazilian state of Paraná. Together, they make up the largest waterfall system in the world. The falls divide the river into the upper and lower Iguazu.

The name `Iguazú` meaning `water` and `big`. Legend has it that a deity planned to marry a beautiful woman named Naipí, who fled with her mortal lover Tarobá in a canoe. In a rage, the deity sliced the river, creating the waterfalls and condemning the lovers to an eternal fall.

## Prebooked - Online
`Iguazu jungle tour` *(they take you on a boat close to the waterfall. You wil be drenched in water completely. Wondderful experience to visit the Falls from so close, its like a nature's roller coaster)*

## How to reach
Morning 4:00AM we booked a taxis before hand to reach Buenos Aires airport and took flight to Iguazu. 
There are multiple taxis which will take you from IGR to the IGuazu national park. its hardly 20 mins ride.
Do try to get them at the earliest. Taxi are readily available outside the iguazu airport.

## Accomodation
We decided to just visit it for a day, hence no worries of booking a place. We arrived early in the morning and left when the park closed at 6:30PM.

Dont expect to see any large cats like jaguar as its lesser in number and most animals prefer to come out at night. 

For the Igazu jungle tips.

- Bring a raincoat or swim dress.
- They will give you dry bag so no need to carry any dry bags.
- Try to sit in front of the boat.
- Everyone removes shoes and put in the dry bag.
- At one time during the ride, you will be completely under the waterfall so you will get completely get wet.
- Go pro would be nice to have
- Bring a lot of water.
- Bring food from wherever you are coming from. Food quality is so so in iguazu fall.
