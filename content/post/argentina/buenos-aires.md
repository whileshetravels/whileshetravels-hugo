Buenos Aires is the capital and largest city of Argentina. The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the `Río de la Plata`, on the South American continent's southeastern coast. `Buenos Aires` can be translated as `fair winds` or `good airs`, but the former was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century, by the use of the original name `Real de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre`.

It is the most visited city in South America, and the second-most visited city of Latin America *(behind Mexico City)*

In the first foundation of Buenos Aires, Spanish sailors arrived thankfully in the Río de la Plata by the blessings of the "Santa Maria de los Buenos Aires", the "Holy Virgin Mary of the Good Winds" who was said to have given them the good winds to reach the coast of what is today the modern city of Buenos Aires.

Took classes at [DNI Tango](https://www.yelp.com/biz/dni-tango-buenos-aires).

You can call them and ask about the schedule of group and private classes and even book it through phone.

First group class is free.

No specific type of dress / shoe is required or even no shoe.

If you have never danced Argentinian Tango and interested to learn it. Before you take a group class, do yourself a favor and take 2 private class. It would be so much more fun after you get some basics privately. Group classes were fun, you exchange partners every song and dance. Group classes are 1.5 hours long and has many levels. We attended Level 1. If you are serious about learning, do take private class. We took 6 classes `(1 technique + 2 practise X 2)`. The teachers were really awesome and patient. It was so much fun to learn and dance.

## Transport
Uber is very much active when we visited `(2019)`. Uber is cheaper then taxis running.

We used Sube card. Trains and bus are very on time and well connected. You need cash to recharge these Sube cards.
You can charge them at the metro station or at stores which have kiosks.

Tip for travelling on bus: `(Same sube card works for bus too)`. You need to tell the driver where you want to go and
driver will punch in the destination and now you have to tap the card on the display.
