So, you wanna see the beautiful city of Budapest and you do not have enough time. D and I had the same problem and D did not even want to be here just for a day, but I somehow managed to plan this trip and it went well. I am leaving Budapest right now for Vienna and I am writing this on a bus. Ha.

We took the train from Brno, Czech Republic to Budapest on Sunday at 2:30 PM and reached Budapest at 6:30 PM. We were exhausted from our Brno trip and starving. All we wanted was to eat and sleep to reset ourselves, but the first thing was figuring out the pass system for public transportation. We went to the information center and got ourselves a 24 hour pass ticket. It costed us about $12 for two people and Budapest has so many buses and trams and metro trains, it is incredible, and Google map makes things a lot easier too. Our first stop in Budapest was Lucky 7 burgers. I had a veg burger and D had a hamburger. Not one of the best burgers I had, but pretty good, and we were full. We went to our Airbnb place. Our host was a nice young lady and we crashed right away in our bed.

We left our place at 7:30 AM for Zoska, a breakfast place. It is really popular in Budapest. We had french toast and scrambled eggs. Yummy. Our first points of interest was Széchenyi Chain Bridge.

SZÉCHENYI CHAIN BRIDGE:

We decided to walk from Zoska to the Chain Bridge. It was a 35 minute walk, but we wanted to explore the city on foot. You should do the same if you do not mind walking. You come across many interesting things which are not famous with tourists. The Chain bridge is easily accessible from the public transport too. You can take M2 metro and get off at Deak Ferenc Ter.

The Chain bridge being one of the most important landmarks in Budapest, spans the Danube river. It is a suspension bridge, and you can walk from Buda to Pest, that is from the western side to the eastern side of the bridge. It is a great spot for taking pictures too, and I took a lot of them and I am sure you will do too. Haha.

THE SHOES ON THE DANUBE BANK

The Shoes on the Danube bank is a memorial on the Danube river bank to remember the jews killed during World War II. The shoes belong to them. It is only a few minute walk from the Chain bridge. We strolled around here and even though it was raining a little, the walk was just perfect.

CASTLE DISTRICT

This is the place where we spent our maximum time. There were many things to see here, but first thing how to reach here. We walked up the hill and you can do too because it is easy, but if you are not up for walking, you can take the funicular from Clark Adam Ter. You can also take bus 16 or 16A from Széll Kálmán Ter. We first stopped at the Royal Palace.

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/382/31306630664_3784b6101e_b.jpg" title="Just posing in front of the Buda Castle" >}}

This Palace has been destroyed and re-built many times and therefore, it is an amalgamation of many architectural styles.

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/465/31999416742_74f46d5f8a_b.jpg" title="So many lions!!" >}}

The Palace consists of the Budapest History Museum and the National Gallery, but they both happened to be closed as we were there on Monday. The whole area was almost empty and perfect to walk around and absorb its beauty.

From the Royal Palace, we went to the Matthias Church. It is a beautiful church built in neo-Gothic style. There are painting which depicts the scenes from the Bible and different eras in Hungary.

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/261/32030161371_e22b2e9f45_b.jpg" title="Inside of the church!" >}}

Close to the Matthias Church, we walked to the Fisherman’s Bastion, which is a lookout terrace. The view of the city from here is splendid. Though we did not eat here, we saw people enjoying their meal and the view at Halászbástya Restaurant. It is something you probably wanna do too.

There are many wonderful restaurants and cafes in the Castle district. We stopped by at Cafe Ruszwurm. We had their cream cake and chestnut chocolate cake. So delicious, especially their cream cake, and quite inexpensive too.

Castle district is a must go place in Budapest. Try visiting here as early as possible when you are fresh and not tired. This place is a World Heritage Site and has to offer many things including the panorama view of the city of Budapest
We took bus 16 to come to the other side of the bridge and visited the following places:

ST. STEPHEN’S BASILICA

It is a beautiful basilica with so much history. The architecture is baroque style. We went all the way to the top, and it is a little challenging because there are many stairs, but you could take the elevator. The view from the above is just incredible. You could see the whole city including the christmas market which is right outside this basilica. We went to Gelarato rosa. Yummy gelato in a rose form.

THE PARLIAMENT BUILDING

Having heard so many good things about the Hungarian Parliament, we had to see it for ourselves. It is only a short walk from the St. Stephen’s Basilica. It is a beautiful piece of architecture. We also happened to watch the march by the guards of the parliament. It was delightful. There is a museum close by called Neprazi museum. We did not go inside, but again, it was beautiful from outside.

We had lunch at Belvárosi Lugas Vendéglő. We had a fish soup and an eggplant layered cooked in a clay pot.
THE HEROES’ SQUARE OR HOSOK TERE

Rather than taking any kind of public transportation, we decided to walk to the Heroes’ Square. It was a little more than half an hour walk. Heroes’ Square made me feel so small. As the name suggests, there are statues of different rulers of Hungary. There is so much space in this square, everything looks tiny. It is at the end of Andrassy avenue and there is a city park next to it, with an ice skating rink. The city park got a castle too named Vajdahunyad Castle. We saw it from outside, but just beautiful.

CHRISTMAS MARKET AT VÖRÖSMARTY TÉR

We ended our day in Budapest by visiting one of the biggest christmas markets in Budapest at Vörösmarty tér. Things were expensive even by American standard, but D got me a handmade neck jewelry for 25 bucks. Sweet!

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/671/31307635694_43ef090722_b.jpg" title="Christmas market at Vörösmarty tér" >}}

There were a lot of Hungarian cuisines, chimney cakes and mulled wine. The atmosphere was just right. It was not super crowded. I just loved it and for us, hot lemon tea was the best take away from this market.
