I am sure you must have had several road trips in your life because come on who does not like a road trip? Right? But honestly, the one in Iceland is nothing like you have had before. It is beautiful to such an extent that it feels surreal. Yes, you might have seen like unlimited pictures of Iceland by now because these days Iceland is a hot tourist spot, but let me tell you something. Those pictures don't do any justice to what we experienced and saw while driving through the famous ring road of Iceland.  Iceland's Ring road, highway 1, makes a circle covering east, west, north, and south covering 828 miles (1332 km). At times, we did make few detours to visit some other amazing attractions, but most of the famous landmarks in Iceland fall on the ring road.

Before you take off, you should use Google my Maps service from Google drive and create your own map with all the attractions you wanna stop by. This is how our map looks like. You can see we used icons to differentiate the types of attractions. For example, for all the waterfalls, we used a green waterfall icon. Similarly, for campsites, we used a blue home icon. It made our road trip really simple and easy.

Here's the summary of how we spent each day in Iceland. This would give you some idea when you plan your own trip. You can thank me later. :-)
