#### Attractions: Hallgrimskirkja, Solfar/Sun Voyager sculpture, Harpa Reykjavik Concert Hall and Conference Centre, Lake Tjornin

It was raining hard on day 9, which was also our last day of our Iceland trip. To be more precise, the whole Euro trip. We did not want to go out really, but of course, we did go out. I did not want to waste my last day just like that.

Our first stop was **Hallgrimskirkja**, a Lutheran Parish church, which also happens to be the tallest church in Iceland. It is named after the Icelandic poet and clergyman, Hallgrímur Pétursson. This church is visible from almost everywhere in Iceland.

I have to tell you I found its architecture pretty unique, from the outside, especially. It is simple yet eloquent. It is interestingly shaped to resemble the way that lava cools into basalt rock.

 The 5200 pipe organ is spectacular and it was great to having some one playing it.

 We were excited to go all the way up the church for the view of the city, but I have to tell you, it did not impress me as much I had expected it to. The ticket costs around 9 USD, and I think it's skippable.

There is a **statue of Leif Eriksson**, an Icelandic explorer. It was a gift from the US to commemorate the 1000th anniversary of Iceland's parliament at Þingvellir in 930 AD.

We next stopped at **Solfar** also known as the **Sun Voyager sculpture**. It is not far from the church we visited earlier. If you are into photography sort of thing, you gotta stop here. Sun Voyager makes a good place for a photo opportunity with the Bay and snow Capet mountains in the background.

Solfar is a massive steel sculpture by Jon Gunnar Arnason. Many people think it represents a viking ship and honestly, it does resemble one. In reality, it is a dream boat and ode to the sun.

Right next to Solfar is located **Harpa Reykjavik Concert Hall and Conference Center**. It is one the most beautiful buildings in Iceland. Though we did not attend any concert or music show, it was worth looking at it from outside and inside.

We had some time before catching our bus back to our Airbnb place. We were just strolling around and came across **Lake Tjornin**. It is a pretty lake with a lot of birds and benches.

There is a church on one side of this lake and colored houses on the other, which makes the whole thing quite picturesque.

And that was it for us. It was still raining and raining hardly, we took the bus back to our Airbnb place. We were going to the airport via a [flybus] (https://www.re.is/flybus/), which is an airport shuttle bus. It costs around 25 USD or 2500 ISK. The bus leaves from BSI bus terminal and takes about 45 minutes to reach the airport. It is not necessary to pre-book it but you should just to be on the safe side.
