Day 7 was our last day with our camping car. We were supposed to drop it off the next day in the morning. There were few things we wanted to cover, but to a large extent, we had kept this day open to see things as we drive.

**Last day with our camper car**

Gesthús Selfoss had started feeling like home and we drove back and forth from Selfoss so many times that I did not even need a Google map at this time to explore that area of the **Golden Circle**.

Our first stop for today was the **Kerið crater lake**. Located 15 Km north of Selfoss, right off highway 35, it is within the Golden Circle. Kerið is a volcanic crater lake, composed of the red volcanic rock. A volcanic crater is basically a circular depression in the ground caused by volcanic activity.

As you can see in the picture below, sapphire-colored waters surrounded by the red background makes a beautiful contrast and the whole thing looks just so colorful.

Unlike many other attractions in Iceland, there is an entrance fee for this lake, 400 ISK or around 3 USD.

**Tip**: *There is no entrance fee after 5 PM as there is no one to collect it.*

We were feeling adventurous and decided to do a full lap around the crater rim. But if you are short on time, you can just walk right down to the water via a number of stairs.

Some people might say it is not as attractive as other things in Iceland, but for me, it was absolutely gorgeous, and in my opinion, totally worth checking.

I had read about **Skalholt**, a historical site in Iceland and one of the most important places in Iceland from 1056 to 1785, we decided to check this out. Also, this is the place where Iceland's first official school was founded.

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4195/34014164734_6e7a157d06_b.jpg" title="Skalholt and its famous cathedral" >}}

At present, Skalholt is famous for its cathedral, which is relatively large compared to other churches in Iceland. The Cathedral is on a little hill over looking some rather stunning views. The interior of the cathedral consists of a modern and beautifully fresh with lovely stained glass windows and art.

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4245/34725418311_b545e67473_b.jpg" title="" >}}

We went inside the church and we got lucky. We saw a bunch of kids and a lady singing. It was really calm and peaceful to hear them singing. There was no other tourist besides us.

We decided to spend some more time here. Outside the cathedral, there were beautiful traditional style houses over looking the even more so beautiful scenery.

Someone had told us last night at the campsite about **Secret Lagoon** hot spring. Even though we were not in the mood to take a dip, we decided let's see what's it got. Many people who don't like to be surrounded by tons and tons of tourists prefer this to Blue Lagoon in the Golden Circle Area. I did walk around the pool, and the surrounding is natural and stunning. You can aslo see the geysir next to the main spring going off every 5-8 minutes. I mean what better sight than that. Right? The temperature of water is just what you need and I saw a good amount of kids too. It costs about 20-25 USD. Don't know the exact number, but definitely less than both Blue lagoon and Myvatn natural bath. Now, I think about it, I am wondering why in the world I did not go in the pool. I mean, yea, I had experienced it once already at Myvatn but surely it wasn't enough. Ah!! Next time.

Another geothermal bath to check out is **Laugarvatn Fontana Geothermal Baths**.  Laugarvatn Fontana is located right next to a lake, where you can look out onto the beach and lake as you sit in the hot tubs and pools.

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4228/34856957435_5ef7c05c11_b.jpg" title="Laugarvatn Fontana Geothermal Baths" >}}

It is not as big as Myvatn or Blue Lagoon, but it has something for everyone from a shallow pool for children to interconnected mineral baths with different depth, size, and temperature.

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4203/34856956345_10fe1d3277_b.jpg" title="" >}}

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4226/34856950405_c935da4bbb_b.jpg" title="Laugarvatn lake" >}}

Our next destination was the **Hrunalaug hot spring**, not very far from Laugarvatn Fontana. This is a natural hot spring where you don't have to pay anything to get wet. There is a small "hut" where you could change clothes but don't expect a lot of privacy though. It is not very big and I have read the owner wants to close it as people are destroying it. Why do we humans ruin everything.

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4197/34047003773_e3c3af0ef5_b.jpg" title="A small hut to change clothes" >}}

The temperature of water is just about right, neither too hot nor cold. Do check out if it's open or not before you go though.

It was around 5 PM and we were getting tired and the anxiety to return the car back tomorrow was taking over us. I was not ready to call it a day yet though. I googled waterfalls I don't remember why and found a couple of them close by. One of them was **Brúarfoss**. I saw its pictures and reviews and I knew right away we gotta go there. Its blue water got me totally enchanted.

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4201/34725204271_7c24be32c0_b.jpg" title="Bruarfoss, one of the most beautiful waterfalls in Iceland" >}}

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4222/34470613940_3069c65b14_b.jpg" title="" >}}

Getting there is not easy. Everyone who has been there would agree with me. We used Google map and it did take us close but of course not close enough. We parked our car near one of the summerhouses and remembered the number of the house in case we get lost. It was number 12.

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4197/34693418702_433ddd2c48_b.jpg" title="This is the road you have to take to reach the bridge" >}}

 We had read we had to cross a wooden bridge first and google map would take you to the bridge with no problem.

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4273/34693421652_1d95f37e56_b.jpg" title="The wooden bridge" >}}

 The trouble is once you reach the bridge. Do you go right?Do you go left? And the trail is full of mud. And there was no one except for us and it was getting late. We decided I would stay right there while D would go both right and left and see if there is any sign of the waterfall. He couldn't find anything and he really wanted to go back. I was reluctant to but was afraid we might get lost or something and that won't be nice. So, we came back to our car but I kept on reading the google reviews and someone had written how her 3 year old kid made it to the waterfall and it's not far from the bridge. I asked my D to give it one more try. If a 3 year old kid can do it, we can too and we were so close to it, we shouldn't give up.  

We crossed the bridge again and went to the right direction. The trail was alright but please wear good shoes. We had walked for about 10 minutes when we started hearing the sound of the water, and I got super happy.

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4272/34693420552_163d0012fc_b.jpg" title="This is how the trail looks like" >}}

Man, that waterfall was everything. The size of the waterfall is not the draw, the seclusion and color is. This was another big highlight of my Iceland trip and I am so glad I read those google reviews and thank you whoever mentioned about her 3 year old daughter making it to this picturesque waterfall.

{{< youtube 6c-XP5HOKeY >}}

Our final stop was another waterfall called Faxi. It is located on The Golden Circle too and another popular tourist spot, though when we visited, we just an Asian guy camping pretty in the parking lot of the waterfall all by himself. Scary and one hell of an experience.

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4248/34856678485_454a0eed49_b.jpg" title="Faxi waterfall" >}}

Anyway, Faxi is not as big as Gullfoss, but you can get personal with this waterfall. You can go pretty close to it. It was an amazing experience having the whole and such a popular waterfall only to us.

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4275/34013841724_e31d748bf6_b.jpg" title="" >}}

And that was it. We went back to our home, well not home, but to our Gesthús Selfoss Campsite, which definitely felt like home. One last time we slept in our beloved camping car. I have to say I did get used to sleeping in it.
