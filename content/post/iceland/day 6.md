#### Driving route: South to Southwest (Golden Circle)
#### Attractions: Þingvellir National Park, Geysir, Gullfoss waterfall
#### Campsite for the night: Gesthús Selfoss Campsite

It was Friday and day 6 of our Iceland road trip. Weather was not looking good for today. There was a high speed wind warning in the south. So, we wanted to keep things calm and light for today. We woke up sort of late. It had rained all night. After our usual routine of taking shower and eating our breakfast, we left for the **Þingvellir National Park**, one of the three national parks in Iceland, and also one of the key attractions within the **Golden Circle**. Hence, it is always crowded.



Our first stop was the visitor center. The lady there was sweet and explained to me the hiking route where we could see a bunch of major things, including the tectonic plates of North America and Eurasia. These plates have split and are drifting apart.To be able to walk between the Eurasian and North American plates is a once in a lifetime experience

The hiking route is easy and can be done by anyone. There are a total of 5 parking lots and you are supposed to pay about 3-4 euros for parking. It was still raining when we were there and a lot and lot of people, mostly from tourist buses.

Þingvellir is consdiered to be the national shrine of Iceland. Why? Well, one of the oldest existing parliaments in the world, Alþingi, first assembled there in 930 AD. And that's the reason it is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Another important attraction of this national park is Oxararfoss. I am sure you know what that is. Hint: Foss. Yes, it is a waterfall. It is beautiful no doubt but had I not seen so many majestic waterfalls already, I would have definitely added more to it. Nonetheless, it is definitely worth checking.

**Hint**: *To access the waterfall, park you car either in the P2 or P3 parking lot. This way you won't have to walk a lot.*

If you are into scuba diving or snorkeling, diving is permitted in two submerged rifts in the National Park, Silfra and Davíðsgja, Silfra being the more famous one, as it is like diving or snorkeling right where the continental plates meet and drift apart.  

We wanted to spend more time at the national park, but it just won't stop raining. We decided to get out from there and check out the next big attraction of the Golden circle, the great **Geysir**.

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4249/34426978200_bc0bfa89e5_b.jpg" title="I present you the Geysir" >}}

The word geyser comes from the Icelandic word "geysir" which means gusher. How cool!

Geysir is super famous and you have to check it out for sure, and just like many things in Iceland, it is absolutely free. I have a crazy memory from this place, but I will talk about that later.

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4170/34650453552_0f459bc833_b.jpg" title="Oh the color!!" >}}

This geyser has been active for almost ten thousand years, with several instances of violent eruptions throughout the years, but it is dormant now. Don't be sad though, because there is another gushing geyser in the area, which is actually the star of the show. It is called **Strokkur**.

Strokkur erupts every 5-7 minutes, which makes it really fun. Everyone waits with their phones/recorders/cameras ready to capture this beautiful natural moment and sometimes it doesn't erupt very high and you could feel the disappointment, but then it would gush out high up in the air from nowhere. Everyone just screams with delight and of course you'll hear everyone say "aahhhh" all together - which creates a fantastic environment that everyone is a part of.

So, first time I made the video of Strokkur erupting, it was all fine as I was not in the direction of the wind. While we were leaving after exploring the area, which took about 30 minutes, I thought let's capture this cool thing again..maybe it would be even better and bigger than the last. D was at a different place than me. So, the Strokkur erupted massively and I got all soaked up. My first thought was shit, I should be all burnt up, but I wasn't. The water is supposed to be at the boiling temperature, but I guess being in the air cools down the water temperature. Some other people got wet too. It was both fun and scary. So, yeah, if water does get on you, don't panic.

There is a geysir center next to the geysir geothermal area. We did a little bit of shopping buying souveniers. We were thinking to get a sweater too, but decided to wait until we reach Reykjavik.

Our final stop for today was the **Gullfoss waterfall**. Gulfoss is another major attraction within the Golden Circle. It is located on the Hvítá (White) river which is fed by Iceland´s second biggest glacier, the Langjökull.

This waterfall is absolutely stunning and magnificient. My picures don't do any justice to its beauty. It is huge and multi-tiered, and it is even possible to walk near the waterfall upto the first cascade, not in winter though, I think. When we visited, the wind was so strong, I felt it gonna blow me away. That was the reason we didn't see many people.

We wanted to stay longer, but it was impossible. The wind that day was just crazy and we were afraid we might not be able to drive back to our campsite, which was the same as the last night, Gesthús Selfoss campsite.

For first few minutes, driving wasn't easy due to the weather, but we managed to reach our campsite safely. They were many people who were the same from the last night. Gesthús Selfoss campsite is really good and popular if you are in the Golden Circle area.
