#### Driving route: East to South East
#### Attractions: Jökulsárlón - Glacier Lagoon
#### Campsite for the night: Vatnajökull National Park campsite

Day 4 was the sunniest and hottest day in Iceland for us, and also the most beautiful day. Our objective for today was to reach south east and camp at Skaftafell National Park, which is actually a part of Vatnajökull National Park now.

Our last night campsite, Egilsstadir, was equipped with hot shower. After bathing and feeding ourselves, we started our today's journey. Out top attraction for today was the Jökulsárlón - Glacier Lagoon.

We came across many not so famous attractions in between. Also, the landscapes were totally different from the north. It started to feel we are approaching the famous touristy south of Iceland.

There were definitely more cars on the road and many attractions, even the minor ones had some people, unlike in the north.

After driving for sometime, we decided to stop at a parking lot and fix ourselves a quick lunch. At this time, we got really comfortable cooking on the road using our small stove.

We were able to hear the sound of water but we thought it's wind for some reason. We finally checked what it was after eating and found out there was a beautiful waterfall and all to ourselves. That was such a beautiful moment for us, I don't even know why.

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4268/34621435412_a649fbc04a_b.jpg" title="Our secret waterfall" >}}

The waterfall was nothing special or anything, but the fact that there was nobody else to share it, we loved it even more.

We spent sometime at the waterfall, admiring the mother nature. We drove further south and a lot of things captured our attention, one of them being this beautiful mountain by a lake. Not sure what it's called. We saw 4-5 people over there, enjoying their lunch or just strolling around.

We decided to have a walk too and it was an easy beautiful walk in a perfect sunny weather.

We continued driving and from nowhere we saw a lot of reindeers. I got super excited and obviously, I wanted to capture those cute things. The moment I stepped outside the car, they somehow sensed me and started running in the opposite direction. I was like whaaaat? Why, dear, why? They were nothing like those wild horses. Reindeers are supposed to be shy. We encountered them again later on and they did the same exact thing. They just won't come to you. There is no point even trying. Just admire them from your car. Lol.

We were craving for some snacks and also had to use restroom. We stopped by a gas station. Got a pack of chips, and coffee and D decided to treat himself with an icecream. We sat outside and met a woman from Chile. No, she wasn't a tourist like us. She has been in Iceland for past 11 years. Her husband, who is from Chile too, is a Spanish teacher and her son, who was 6 years old, looked like a typical Icelander, surprisingly. He was so cute though. She was able to speak broken English and we used google translator to communicate. We had fun conversation. We tried showing her our failed spanish speaking skills. Lol.

After having such a wonderful day, we finally made it to the **Jökulsárlón - Glacier Lagoon**. This glacier lagoon is one of the top attraction of Iceland. When we visited, it was pretty packed up. In summer, it must be a crazy site here.

This lagoon is formed naturally due to the glacier melting and it is getting bigger each year. Thank you Global warming and all those people who don't believe in it!!!!

This lagoon has large chunks of ice all over. Some of them big enough to be called icebergs. It took me down the memory lane to my trip to Bear Glacier in Alaska. Therefore, I was not totally awed by its beauty having seen something similar already. If you have not seen anything like this before, be prepared to have your mouth and eyes wide open. It truly is many wonders of the world. It is possible to take boat tours in this lagoon. It is even possible to do ice caving in wintertime. Ice caving is on our to-do-list.

We saw 7-8 seals swimming and relaxing in the lagoon, and they were stars of the lagoon show.

We spent a good amount of time here, seeing the lagoon from both bottom and top. It was a splendid view for sure.

We were ready to call it a day. We drove to the Vatnajökull national park, our campsite for tonight, we saw the Vatnajökull glacier widely spread out. Why? Because Vatnajökull is the biggest glacier in Europe outside the arctic, with a surface area of 8,100 km squares.

Turned out the Vatnajökull National Park campsite was closed though there was a clean big restroom and drinking water available. We like many other camping cars parked the car in the parking lot and decided to stay there for the night.
