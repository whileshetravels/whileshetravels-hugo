We stepped outside and it was chilly and beautiful. Everything was covered with a thin sheet of snow and it seemed white mountains are calling me. But before that, we had to have our breakfast. We had some water in our bottles. We brushed quickly and took out our small stove and a frying pan. We wanted to fix ourselves some eggs. It turned out our stove was not working. We tried looking for some youtube videos but it did not help. We decided to get out from that place and eat at a gas station or something and try fixing the stove later. We stopped at many places since everything was just so beautiful.

Looking at this mailbox, I kept on wondering if postmen come here to drop mail. It did not even look anyone even lived there. Everything was so deserted. Later, we did see a postman. That answered my question.

We came across some wild horses again and since they were still new for us, we had to take their pictures.

On our way, we stopped at the most photographed mountain of Iceland, Kirkjufell, which means “church mountain”. It is a 463m high mountain on the north coast of Iceland’s Snæfellsnes peninsula, near the town of Grundarfjörður, which has about 900 residents.

Though we did not climb up this mountain, it is possible to do so. It is a 3 hour round trip and challenging, especially if you have vertigo. It is highly recommended to hike with a guide. You can find more information here.

Next to the Kirkjufell mountain, there is also a waterfall called Kirkjufellsfoss. Foss means waterfall in Iceland. The whole thing looks so scenic and heavenly.

From there, we kept on driving further up to the north, stopping again at several locations.

We did not come across many other cars and there were times, we were the only people on the road. It was a strange and eerie feeling. We were only surrounded by big mountains which were wholly or partially covered with snow.

Leifur Eiriksson was the first known European to have discovered North America (excluding Greenland), before Christopher Columbus.

Eiríksstaðir was the farm of Eiríkur rauði (Erik the red), who later settled Greenland. The re-construction is based on the ruins located a short distance away, further up the hill.

For the night, we ended up in a town called Akureyri, nicknamed as the Capital of North Iceland. Akureyri is a big town with its own international airport. We found a campsite here called Hamrar. It was open and there were a good amount of camper cars. The price was 1400 Icelandic Kronas per person. The campsite was equipped with hot showers, restrooms, a kitchen, and a common dining area, which is huge.

We met two girls there, one from France and other from Sweden. i slept like a baby in our camper car that night. And that’s how day 2 in Iceland ended.
