Had three kinds of flamingos.
Learned that flamingoes 
Andean, James, and Chilean

Flamingos are pink or orange or white depending on what they eat. Flamingos eat algae and crustaceans that contain pigments called carotenoids. For the most part, these pigments are found in the brine shrimp and blue-green algae that the birds eat.

We arrive into this natual habitat of hundreds of flamingos-Chilean, Andean and James, Baird's Sandpipers, Puna Plovers and Andean Seagulls that roam these waters.

Miscanti Lake is a brackish water lake located in the altiplano of the Antofagasta Region, in northern Chile. Miñiques volcano and Cerro Miscanti tower over this lake. This heart-shaped lake has a deep blue color. The western shoreline of the lake is separated by less than 1 km from the drainage divide between the lake and the Salar de Atacama basins.

A lava flow from an eruption of Miñiques separated Miscanti Lake from Miñiques Lake
The lake is part of one of the seven sectors of Los Flamencos National Reserve.


We start the final stretch, the direct ascent to the plateau. As the vehicle begins to climb, you notice the effects of the altitude. The car slows down at times, and the oxygen decreases which makes the combustion more difficult. Once we get close to the plains, the landscape astonishes us.

The shades of green and yellow grass together with the snowy peaks are a magnificent sight before our eyes. It is suprising to find such a perfect plateau between mountains. Birds fly from one place to another, crossing in front of the windshield. The vicunas, which roam free, feed off of the wild straw that abounds in this area.

## Miniques lagoon

Only a steep hill separates us from our final destination in the distance. Cerro Miscanti appears first and then the volcano Miniques. At its feet, two majestic lakes bearing the same name dazzle anyone. The taguas cornudas that live here make their nests on the shore of the lagoon. The deep blue water, frozen on the edges and surrounded by snowy peaks appears to be a landscape straight out a fairytale. Not evenn the icy temperatures nor the penetrating winds are able to obscure the magical landscape hidden 4,000 meters above sea level located in the Chilean Altiplano.

This area forms part of the Flamenco National Reserve, and the native community of Socaire manages it. The landscape was different in the past with thawing waters from the Miscanti and Meniques volcanoes running freely down to the Atacama Salt Flats. However, the eruption of the Meniques volcanoes 1 million years algo resulted in the stagnation of water thus forming these two intense blue water lagoons surrounded by white banks. Several archeological sites are found in this area containing ceramics fragements, arrow heads, and 40 circular stone constructions that stand as proof of an existing population around 3,000 - 4,000 B.C.

On our way back to San Pedro de Atacama, we made a brief stop where the imaginary line Tropic of Capricorn intersecting with the highway
