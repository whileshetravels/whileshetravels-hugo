The archealogoical capital of Chile is located at tee base of the High Lands, at the basin of the San Pedro River(*the biggest river to reach the Atacam Salt Flats*).

This beautiful town is named after its patron saint San Pedro (*Saint Peter*), and the word Atacama, which, according to the ancestors comes from `Accatchca` in the Cunza language and means Head of the Country. Over time, this term underwent many modifications until it arrived at today's pronunciation. It was conquered by the Incas in 1450 and then by the Spaniards in 1540 becoming a cabildo (*a Chilean government seat*) in 1555.

The town square is without a doubt one of the main attractions of Chile's archeological capital. There is nothing better then to watch time go under its enormous pepper or molle trees which will cool you off in the summer evenings.

The main street is Caracoles in earlier days mines worker walk on this street on the way to the Caracoles silver. In present days, all the tour operators and restaurants are all along this street.

The main street is Caracoles, so named because in earlier days miners left from here to work in the Caracoles silver mine discovered in 1870 by Diaz Gana. Now a days you can find nice restaurants, tourist agencies and stores, which welcome tourists from all over the world.

- `Stay:` Airbnb options are pretty good.

- `Restaurant:` Best restaurant is [Adobe](https://www.yelp.com/biz/adobe-restaurant-san-pedro-de-atacama). Do try there Quinoa risotto.

- `Tour planning:` Del Tatio Geysor do it at the last. You need as many days to aclimiatize. If you are trying to do Lascar Volcano, do it after Del Tatio Geysor. It will help alot.

- `Booking tours:` If you are going during the off season like we did (*winter season*), you can book by visiting the store and bargain and do multiple bookings.

- `Star gazing:` Best time to do star gazing which is a must is during winter (no rain and less chances of cloud). Even if the star gazing tour is expensive which we used, it was once in a lifetime experience.

- `Ice-cream:` Please do try Ice-cream at [Heladeria Babalú](https://www.yelp.com/biz/heladeria-babal%C3%BA-san-pedro-de-atacama). They make fresh ice-cream and they have fresh ice-cream made from Rica Rica, Quinoa, coca, ayrampo
