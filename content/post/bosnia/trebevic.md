**Trebević mountain** is so close to Sarajevo yet it feels so far. It was one of the favorite hangout places for Sarajevans before the war. During the war, heavy fighting took place here and most of the infrastructures got destroyed. A good portion of Trebević was mined, but it is pretty safe now, but one still gotta be careful.

We had heard so much good things about the mountains in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and we really wanted to hike at least one of them. After doing some research, we found out that a local company called Green Visions organizes a guided tour to Trebević. In winter, when there is a lot of snow, they do snowshoe hike, but we did a regular hike as there was not a huge amount of snow. Let me start by saying this company Green Visions is one of the best tour companies. They are so professional. Samer was very helpful and replied to my emails right away every time and our guide, Sabrina, was an adventurous friendly lady. It was a fun day for us and we had well spent 80 euros for two people.

Our day started with Sabrina picking us up at 9 AM, at the location of our choice, which was a restaurant called Inat Kuca or also called “House of Spite.” Our guide told us the history of the restaurant, which is interesting, and I would like to share. During the rule of Austrian-Hungarian empire, City Hall was being built and Inat Kuca, which was a residential place then, was supposed to be demolished, but the owner was against that and he demanded to move his house brick by brick to the other side of the river in its original form, and he succeeded. And now, it is one of the top restaurants in Sarajevo with some great views. Back to our hike, Sabrina drove us to Jahorina via Vraca to Brus, where she parked her car. Brus is like a tourist complex with restaurants, bungalows, man-made pond, walking trails and bike paths. Locals who do not hike up to the mountains come here on weekends to enjoy and relax.

We took the hiking poles which our guide has brought with her and I am so glad we did. There was a good amount of snow and at times, the trail would really get icy and I hate to walk on ice. I just can’t handle it.

D kept telling me how to walk on it, but there was no way, I could have. I always had to re route and I was kind of slowing our guide and D, but whatever. I did not want to fall down or slip my way and break my bones. On the way, we stopped by the spring, where we refilled out bottle with fresh mountain water.
We saw some trail marks, but there were not many, and for the first timer, it could be confusing.

We hikes most of the way through pine and spruce covered forests. We also saw some mountain houses destroyed during the war. We made it to the top around 12 PM. We not only saw Sarajevo but also all immediate surrounding towns and villages, as well as mountains of Bukovik, Ozren, Crepoljsko, Romanija, Ravna planina, Jahorina, Maglić, Bioč, Volujak, Zelengora, Lelija, Treskavica, Visočica, Bjelašnica, Igman, Prenj, Čvrsnica, Vran, Bitovnja, Raduša, Vranica, Vlašić, Perun, Zvijezda.

In our tour, lunch was included too. We had a little picnic by the peak of the mountain, which is 1629 meters high. Sabrina had prepared such a delicious meal, which included two types of bread, chicken breast, dried beef, fruits, different types of soup, olives, avjar, which is a red pepper spread and yummy, coffee, and tea.

We saw few people up on the top but not a huge crowd. After spending some time up on the top, it started to get really chilly, and we made our way back. This time we took an alternative path, which was steeper. The wind was absolutely crazy. I thought it would blow me away like for real and we were walking on the edge all the time. Some adrenaline rush it was. I do not have any picture because I was too scared to take any. I did not even think about taking a picture. lol. First half an hour was super scary, but it got better after that and we reached the parking lot by 3 PM. We decided to grab a coffee in a nearby place. Sabrina was a friend to us by then and I even added her on Facebook and invited her to California. She told us about some possible day trips from Sarajevo and how to reach those places. We talked about her life. She was a shepherd in Iceland once for 3 months. You can imagine what an adventurous girl she is. She was only 5 during the time of the war and she explained how her parents lost everything in the war.
She even made a de tour and took us to the 1984 Winter Olympics bobsled track.

She dropped us at the same spot she picked us from and we were home by 5 PM.

I really think if you have some time in Sarajevo, and like to be in nature, you should consider hiking Trebević. It is not only a great way to be away from Sarajevo but also to experience the city of Sarajevo naturally. There used to be a cable car running before from Bistrik neighborhood of Sarajevo to all the way top to Vidikovac (1164 meters). The process to reinstall the cable car connection is on the way and it would be excellent for tourism.
If you want to hike on your own without any guide, it is doable, but the trails are not that well marked, to be honest. You can catch a city bus, which runs from Latinska Ćuprija on the weekends. In summer, hiking without a guide is more possible and you can follow the locals, but then you won’t have a guide like Sabrina. :)
