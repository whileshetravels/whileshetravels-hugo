Montmartre is a hill situated in Paris’ 18 arrondissement and this neighborhood is quite different from the arrondissement we had been to. It is trendy, crowded, and kind of seedy, and a place where many famous people have lived or worked from Van Gogh to Pablo Picasso. Even now, there are many artists and portraitists working here to exhibit and sell their artwork.

We left on a Saturday afternoon using metro, line 4 and got off at Barbes. Man, that train was super crowded, something I had never seen before in Paris. After getting of the metro train, we had to walk for about 10 minutes.

We walked up the hill to Sacré-Couer Basilica, the most famous sight in Montmarte. It was a pleasant walk and one can do it easily. Alternatively, there is a funicular which runs near the Anvers metro. You could also take the bus called Montmartrobus from Place Pigalle which drops you right by the Basilica.

Before entering the church, we stopped by for the view of Paris from Paris’s highest natural point, which is 420 feet. It was not the day with the clearest of skies, but the view was still pretty good. This place must be spectacular at night and we would definitely come back one of these nights just for the view.

Sacré-Cœur Basilica which is also called the Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Paris is a Roman Catholic church dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The first thing we saw after entering the church, which is free, was a 60 feet tall Christ exposing his sacred heart for the sake of humanity. The view of the Nave is unique indeed.

There is a scale model of the church where we were able to see the central dome of the church surrounded by smaller domes, and the tower.

The church also has colorful mosaics and a bronze statue of St. Peter.

I bet you are thinking these stained glass windows in the picture below are very old. Guess what?They are not. The original windows were destroyed during world war 2. These were constructed after WWII.

After coming out from the church, we stopped by at Place du Terte. The feeling was totally bohemian. Place du Terte is a square where we found a lot of artists doing painting or sketching and for some money, they were sketching portraits of people too, though we did not get our portraits done.

We were just strolling around and the place is full of cafes and restaurants. We stopped by La Cave Gourmande and had fish soup which we shared. The soup was alright for me, but D found it delicious.

We found Vincent Van Gogh’s house at 54 Rue Lepic. He lived here with his brother for 2 years and was at his peak.

And we ended our Montmartre walk with a glance at Moulin Rouge, a cabaret in Paris, which is all red in color with an addition of Red Windmill. Apparently, this is the place which gave birth to the modern form of the cancan dance. Today, for a very high price, you can catch a dance show here.

Montmartre is very different from other parts of Paris but if you wanna experience the true French culture and appreciate the artists and their work and enjoy the Basilica and the view of Paris or just want to soak up in the atmosphere where various famous artists had lived or worked, you should definitely visit this place.
