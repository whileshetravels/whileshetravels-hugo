If you are in Paris and have seen everything, and want to get away from the City of lights and its crowd for some time, Crécy-la-Chapelle would be an ideal place to do so.

Crécy-la-Chapelle is a small town and you can call it a mini Venice. It takes only an hour from Paris. We had been thinking to visit this town since some time and after missing our train to Mont Saint Michel, we finally did it. We took the suburban train P from Gare de l’Est to Gare d’Esbly and then transferred to another train, which is also called P, from Esbly to Crecy la Chapelle. So, it is a total of 2 train rides: Paris to Esbly and Esbly to Crecy la Chapelle, and takes about an hour altogether. When we got off at Esbly, we took the stairs and reached the other side of the platform and P train to Crécy-la-Chapelle was waiting for us. We used this [website](https://www.transilien.com/fr/itineraire/arrivee-CRECY%20LA%20CHAPELLE-2.905289258408-48.859285194029) to plan our journey.

We visited on a Sunday afternoon which meant we had missed the Sunday market. Dang! It is a quiet town and we did not see many people and that made our trip even more pleasant. It is crossed by the river Grand morin and we saw a narrow lane of this river everywhere.

It was a cold day and we were the only two brown people there. So, obviously, people were staring at us. Having traveled in Europe quite a bit, we are used to it by now.

After wandering around and taking pictures, we decided to eat. We did not check yelp this time and randomly entered a restaurant called Le Korrigan.

There were a good amount of people already having lunch and they all must be thinking what these two brown people are doing here as they were looking surprised seeing us. The staff barely spoke English, but we managed and were seated upstairs. D went downstairs to order and everyone including the customers helped him understanding the menu. A woman even took out her phone for translation. How sweet. Contrary to the popular belief that French people are arrogant and not helpful, we found them hospitable.

We ordered a vegetarian crepe first followed by a chocolate crepe and they both were delicious and costed us a total of 15 euros.

We left the restaurant at 2 PM and our train was at 2:35 PM. We explored the town a little more before coming to the train station. Returning to Paris was exactly the same. We transferred at Esbly for Paris and was in Paris by 3:30 PM.

I was sad in the morning having missed my train to Mont Saint Michel, but a short stay at Crécy-la-Chapelle was peaceful and a good break from the overcrowded Paris. It was a time well spent at Crécy-la-Chapelle.
