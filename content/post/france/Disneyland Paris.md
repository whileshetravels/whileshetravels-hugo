We were really tired doing this sightseeing and wanted to do something different. Having never been the Disneyland Florida before, we thought let’s try the one here in Paris. We knew this one is not as good as the one in Florida after doing a ton of research, but it was worth a shot and I was in a mood of some adrenaline rush.

We decided to visit on a weekday where there is less rush. We bought the tickets for one day online for 36 euros/person which included both disney studio and disney park. This was a special offer which could not be bought at the gate. I took the screen shot of the ticket and it worked well. So, save paper and do not print your tickets if you have a smartphone. Please bring a photo ID with you. You will be asked at the gate.

### HOW TO GET TO DISNEYLAND PARIS FROM PARIS

Getting to disneyland from Paris is pretty easy. It takes about an hour to get there. We took RER A towards Gare de Marne la Vallee Chessy and Gare de Marne la Vallee Chessy was the last stop and that’s where you wanna get off too. When you take RER A, make sure you look for the stops at one of these boxes at your platform and there should be a yellow light next to Gare de Marne la Vallee Chessy. If there is not, that’s not the right train. The picture below will make more sense.

We wanted to cover all the exciting big thrill rides and were not really interested in the entertainment section. We picked up a free map and also a brochure of all the running programmes with their location and timetable. Some rides have fast passes which means you do not have to wait in the line for those rides. You would see a machine next to the waiting line and you would scan your ticket and get your fast pass. It tells you what time period you should come back to assess the ride without waiting much. For example, we started with Big thunder mountain in disneyland park. We got there by 10:30 AM and got the fast pass. We were supposed to come back between 12:30 to 1:30 PM.

These are the rides we got on at disneyland and I tell you they all are so good.

### DISNEYLAND PARK

* Big Thunder mountain - It is a big thrill ride, can be scary.

* Indiana Jones - This is also one of the big thrill rides with a turn of 360 degrees.

* Buzz Light year laser blast - You must have guessed it, this ride is all about laser. Kids would love it. It includes a pretty sweet competition with your partner.

* Phantom Manor - A spooky ride for kids and for adults too.

* Meet for Mickey mouse - Though we did see Mickey greeting others, both kids and adults, we did not meet him. If you are interested, you would find him at the park in fantasyland.

### WALT DISNEY STUDIOS PARK

* Tower of Terror - I do not want to talk much about it because this is one of those rides which creates so much mystery that you would really think if you should do it. Yes, I did have a similar thought. Based on the popular TV show, the Twilight Zone, it is a free fall ride and I tell you, it is gonna be scary but so much adventurous too. We did not get a fast pass for this one and regretted it a lot. We were in the line for an hour. So, do yourself a favor and get a fast pass.

* Rock and Roller coaster - This was one hell of a roller coaster. 360 degrees loop, super fast, sudden twist and turn and and and dark..with some lightening at times. Its theme is you guessed it “Rock and Roll.” We did not have to get a fast pass for this as the line was super short. There was a birthday boy aged around 5-6 waiting in the line, but he backed off at the last minute. My husband got a little dizzy at the end and I loved it.

* Crush Coaster - It is based on the movie, Finding Nemo, and it would not disappoint you. It is a fun ride and at times could be scary.

* Peter Pan’s flight - If you are going with kids, you must stop here. The line was long but it was worth it. Sailing high into the moonlight sky sitting in the flight of Peter Pan, we came across many scenes from the movie Peter Pan.

### EATING IN DISNEYLAND

I had read everywhere that the food is expensive and the quality is bad. Therefore, we ate Nutella crepes from one of the stands on the main street near the castle.

### DISNEY MAGIC ON PARADE

This was one of the best parades I have ever been to. This parade is held everyday at 5:00 PM on the main street, where all the famous disney characters show up dancing and singing and with music on, it is such a wonderful environment.

We left as soon as the parade got over and the way back to Paris was the same way. Took RER A towards Paris. Next day we woke up all refreshed and energized. If you are in Paris for some time and need a good break from all the sight seeings and want some adrenaline rush, disneyland paris should be your top choice, and if you have a kid, you know you gotta be here.
