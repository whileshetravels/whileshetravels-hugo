Notre Dame de Paris meaning “Our Lady of Paris” is one of the largest and famous churches in the world. It is a fine example of Gothic architecture and being in Paris, if you do not see the Notre Dame de Paris, even just the cathedral which is free, it is really your loss. If possible, make sure you go all the way up the tower (not free) and admire the city of lights and gargoyles.

The construction of the church started in 1163 and finished in 1345. It is one of the first buildings to use the flying buttress and it is also very famous for its gorgoyles, which is basically to drain out water.

We took the metro, line 4 and got off at  Saint-Michel-Notre-Dame stop. We reached there around 12 PM and the line was super huge. We decided to come back early next day and in the meantime explore the outside. This place looks so good from outside too it’s ridiculous. Such a beautiful piece of Gothic architecture. We were taking pictures and admiring how wonderful the whole thing is.

 In the above picture, you can see a man holding his head. He is Saint Denis who was decapitated because got on the bad side of the Pagan priests when Paris was still a Roman city. He got many people converted to christianity.

 We got into the line right away and we were inside the church in no time. As expected, it was dark inside but beautiful.

We came back next day to get on the tower. In order to assess the tower, you need to go on the left side of the facade outside the cathedral. Man, the line was huge and it was moving super slow unlike the line to get inside the cathedral. It was due to the fact that they allow only a certain amount of people to get on the top. After waiting in the line for almost an hour, we were finally able to get in. We bought the tickets for 10 euros each (free if you hold a museum pass), and then started climbing the stairs. There is no elevator. You gotta be in good shape to climb those narrow never ending steps (387 of them).

And once you are done, you are greeted with such a view you would appreciate yourself for being so courageous to climb those steps.

After getting on top, it made sense why they allow only certain amount of people at one time, as it would become impossible to walk around and it would really ruin the view with so many people. Yes, it is a long wait and I can’t even imagine how it must be during summer, but I say, do it because it is worth it.
