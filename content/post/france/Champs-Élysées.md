I have always heard about the Avenue des Champs-Élysées pronounced as *Shon-zay-LEE-zay*, that how grand and Parisian this avenue is. Taking a stroll around this avenue on a rainy January night made me feel a Parisian too, temporarily. We took metro line 9 and got off at Franklin D Roosevelt and that’s where the Avenue des Champs-Élysées started.

Known for its cafes, theaters, branded shops, Bastille Day Military Parade and the Tour de France, Avenue des Champs-Élysées stretches between Place de la Concorde and the Arc de Triomphe, which is one of the most famous monuments in Paris.

Arc de Triomphe as the name suggests is an arch which is 165 foot/50 meter high built to honor Napoleon’s soldiers who won at the Battle of Austerlitz. Since then a lot victorious armies pre and post World War II have marched under or around the arc.

We saw the arc from the other side without crossing the roundabout first. There were hardly any people but the traffic was at its peak. I wanted to cross and get to the Arc but there was no way I could have done it. After taking some snaps, we were thinking to leave, but I don’t know how we crossed the road and found the underground pedestrian walkaway and on the left side we saw a ticket booth to walk up to the arch. The ticket was 12 euros and we were kind of skeptic first, but we thought, what the hell..let’s go up. There was a security check which took just a few minutes.

Number of steps to reach the top of the Arc: 284. If you are not in a decent shape, this can be challenging, but do it anyway.

Paris is a beautiful city we all know that, and Paris at night is more beautiful we know that too, but to experience that beauty is lot better than hearing it from your friends, your family, or even me.

It was freezing with snow shower at the top and our hands were dead, but that did not stop us from appreciating the city of lights which is home to 11 million people. You could see all the famous monuments of Paris from the Eiffel Tower to the dome of Sacré-Couer.

And gazing down, we saw a beautiful mess of the traffic with the psychedelic ferris wheel at the other end.

Going up the steps, we found a resting place which also has a small exhibition area where you can see some cool videos about the Arc de Triomphe. We were freezing and decided to sit down while enjoying the video. We also visited a gift shop and bought a cool Paris post card.

After coming down, we explored the area a little. There is tomb of the unknown soldiers from World War 1.

Everyday at 6:30 in the evening since World War 1, there’s been a rekindling of the flame with new flowers set in.

Avenue des Champs-Élysées is one of those places you can totally brag about to your friends and family that you have been there. Even if you do not climb up the Arc, just stroll around the Arc and walk this high standard Parisian boulevard and maybe shop a thing or two.

Edit: I strolled around the Avenue des Champs-Élysées again and this time during day and alone and it was a total different experience. The weather was just perfect and I did some shopping at Sephora while popping in other stores just to do some window shopping.

So, this American company, Abercrombie & Fitch has a store which looks like a palace. I did go in and it is built at a grand scale. There are more tourists here than actual shoppers. Ha. I was one of them.
