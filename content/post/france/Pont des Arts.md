Pont des Arts is that famous bridge where couples used to make their love for each other memorable by attaching love lock with their names engraved or written to the railing or the grate of the bridge and tossing the keys into the Seine river below. No, this trend did not start centuries ago. It was pretty recent. The year was 2008.

I might have done the same with D though he would have disapproved for sure, but since 2014, the locks have been removed as they’re damaging the bridge with their weights.

Nonetheless, the bridge remains a romantic place and walking hands in hands with your lover over this bridge is lovely and a typical Parisian experience.

Pont des Arta is a beautiful pedestrian only bridge which connects the Left Bank and the Right Bank, and the view from both the banks are gorgeous and with the additional of Eiffel Tower in the background, it is a heaven for all those crazy photographers.

I still have few more days in Paris, and I would return here during night time. We walked up to the Institut de France and it is a beautiful building.

Not very far from the bridge around the other side of the Institut de France , we came across Voltaire..i mean his statue. He was the one who said, “Common sense is not so common.” Boy, he was right.

If you love Oscar Wilde like I do, you might wanna stop by his hotel where he died due to an ear infection.

It is just a 4 minute walk from Pont des Arts and its address is 13 Rue des Beaux Arts. Now this hotel is a fancy one with a Michelin Star restaurant. Thank you, Oscar Wilde.

We were getting kinda hungry after strolling around and we had a coffee eclair for 8 euros (I know right, 8 euros?) at a cafe called Cafe la Plaette, which is more than 100 years old.

Nothing has been changed here. The cafe looks super old and the mirrors are all marked with stains.
