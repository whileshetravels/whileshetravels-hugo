Luxembourg Garden is nothing you have not seen before, but to find such a spacious place in Paris which is ideal for both children and adults is not easy, and that’s what makes this garden so special.

Luxembourg Garden is situated on the Left Bank and it is well maintained. It has a lot of benches and chairs and we were just sitting there for almost an hour.

It was created by Marie de’ Medici, the widow of king Henry IV of France in 1612 as the garden of the Luxembourg Palace. Though we did not go inside the palace, it looked beautiful from outside.

This garden is about 60 acres and owned by the French Senate, which meets in the palace.

There are a lot of statues and fountains here including the Statue of Liberty. I can imagine it must be a great spot for picnic in summer.

In January, there were not many tourists. We saw a lot of locals with their kids and dogs. It is beautiful place to run, jog, or even just a simple walk.
