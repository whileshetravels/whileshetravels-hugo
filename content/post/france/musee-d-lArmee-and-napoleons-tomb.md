The Musée de l’Armée or the Army museum as the name suggests exhibits France’s complete military history along with the tomb of Napoleon. It is a perfect place if you love history. Even if you do not, you should visit this museum just for Napoleon, the man who conquered almost every part of Europe.

We left at 11 in the morning and took metro, line 8  and got off at La Tour Mauborg. From there it is just a 5 minute walk and you won’t miss it as you would see the golden dome of Les Invalides Church and that’s where Napoleon rests. The ticket costs 12 euros/person and covers everything from Napoleon’s Tomb to all museum collections within Invalides complex.

Without wasting any time, we entered the church to see the tomb of Napoleon, which is pretty grand and appears to be a separate room within the church.

Napoleon was born in Corsica to a modest family and after joining the military, he rose through the ranks pretty quickly eventually becoming the Emperor of France.  He won many wars for France before falling down to Russia. He was exiled on South Atlantic island of St. Helena and eventually dying there.

Napoleon’s battles are written on the floor near his tomb and you could see for yourself how many battles he won. No wonder he is considered to be the greatest commander in history.

Also, near his tomb, we found some badass statues of Napoleon.

This place also has tombs of Napoleon’s family, his elder brother, Joseph who was a king of Spain, his younger brother, Jerome, who was a king of German kingdom of Westphalia and also Napoleon’s baby boy, Napoleon II.

Exiting the church, we entered the two World Wars section which exhibits both World War I and II. We had no trouble finding it as signs are posted everywhere. These rooms show the military history of France from 1871 to 1945. France lost to Germany in 1871 in Franco-Prussian war and that led to the WWI.

The collections include different uniforms wore by French and its colonies.

It also includes various objects used by soldiers in their daily lives like shaving kit for instance. There are prestige pieces like marshal’s batons and ceremonial swords.

We ended our tour by visiting Old department, Old Armor and Weapons, 13th-17th century, which contains one of Europe’s major collections of weapons and armors. The military history of this collection ranges from the 13th to the 17th century.

The Army museum is an interesting place. It is well organized and very educational. The tomb of Napoleon is a bonus. Give yourself a minimum of 2 hours. If you are interested in wars and ammunitions, you can be here for one full day.
