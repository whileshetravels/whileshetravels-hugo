Père Lachaise Cemetery is one of the most peaceful cemeteries I have ever been to not to mention it is quite big and free, and in the month of January, it was so calm that it gave a kind of an eerie feeling. I know all cemeteries do. It got about 5000 trees and does look like a park. It is a star cemetery filled with the tombs of Oscar Wilde to Jim Morrison.

We left around 11 in the morning and took the Metro, line 3 to Gambetta. There are other metro stations close by too, but Gambetta is better as the the tomb of Oscar Wilde is close to it.

Buy a map which is sold at the entrance or download a map from [here] (https://api-site.paris.fr/images/74643). Otherwise, you would be lost or might not be able to see what you came here to see.

We started with the Crematorium which is marked by a dome and you could see working chimneys flame on top. We stepped inside and saw many small cubicles for cremated remains.

Close to the Crematorium, we found Oscar Wilde. Having read many of his books, it was kind of emotional to be standing next to his grave. His tomb is behind glass and people like to kiss it.

This cemetery also remembers the victims of the concentration camps in the form of statues.

After visiting few other people graves, we came across the Communards’ Wall or Mur des Fédérés in French. This wall is where 147 Communards were killed and buried by the French soldiers. These Parisians were opposing Prussia which invaded France in 1870. The French government had surrendered already and were helping the Prussians against the Parisians. Paris, a city which is not only beautiful but cares a great deal about its honor.

Our next stop was Edith Piaf, one of France’s greatest international stars. Born in Paris, she was discovered by a nightclub owner. She was at her peak during the World War 2, popular among the German soldiers in France too. She died in 1963 at the age of 47. Her last words were, “Her last words were “Every damn thing you do in this life, you have to pay for.”

And then we made our way to Jim Morrison, the most visited tomb in the cemetery. Jim was an American rock star. He was a singer for the popular rock band The Doors, who died in Paris probably due to an overdose of drugs.

Frédéric Chopin, one of the greatest pianists the world has ever seen is also buried here though his heart is in Warsaw, where he was born. Honestly, I am not his big fan as I have barely listened to his work, but D is his great admirer. There were flowers on his gravestone, telling how much people still loves him.

We ended our tour with the visit of the tomb of Baron Georges-Eugene Haussman, the one who was responsible for the modernization of Paris. All those wide roads and lanes in Paris are due to this man vision.

It might sound a little bizarre visiting a cemetery on your trip to Paris, but hey, if you can’t see these people while they were alive, better meet them when they are no more. Right?
