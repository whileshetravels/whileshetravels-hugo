Honestly, I have never been a museum enthusiast, but Paris is kind of a mecca of museums with the work of many world famous artists. The first place I visited in Paris was Musée d'Orsay pronounced as mew-zay-dor-say. Being one of the largest art museums in Paris, it houses the work of Manet, Monet, Cézanne, Van Gogh, Rodin, Gauguin and many other famous artists. You would find Impressionism at its best here. Impressionism was an art movement started in the 19th century in Paris and quickly spread out to other parts of Europe and the US. The impressionists brushstroke would be light and loose and the subject would be something more real like a painting of sunflowers or a sunset.

This museum, just like every other place in Paris, is crowded in summer. D and I visited just a few days ago, which is on January 5, 2017 and we were able to buy tickets for 12 euros/person from the museum ticket counter without wasting any time. We took RER-C train and got off at Musée d’Orsay stop. We took the entrance A as we had to purchase our tickets. If you have your tickets purchased already or have a museum pass, take the entrance C. We had to undergo a security check just like everyone else and with less people, it went smoothly. On Thursday, the museum closes late. So, it would be a good day to visit. Avoid Sunday and Tuesday and the Louvre museum is closed that day and the crowd moves to the Orsay.

We decided to get the audioguide in English for 5 euros because well, we wanted to know more about the paintings and the sculptures. The audioguide gave so much more meaning to our visit to this museum. I would highly recommend getting one of those. After picking our free map, we started our tour.

We started with the grand central aisle on the ground floor, where we came across with many interesting pieces of art including the Statue of Liberty of the Musée d'Orsay, commissioned by the same sculptor, Bartholdi, who designed the Statue of liberty of the US. Having seen the SOL from the Staten Island ferry so many times, it made me happy to see its mini version in Paris.

We next visited the main gallery, which was dedicated to the conservative art. There were two paintings which stood out for me: Dante et Virgile and Naissance de Vénus both by William Bouguereau. Dante et Virgile is based on Dante’s the Divine Comedy, where one man is biting another man on neck and a devil is smiling at the back and Dante and Virgile are just looking at.

As the name suggests, the subject of Naissance de Vénus is Venus, a mythological character. She is standing in the middle, naked, and in kind of a seductive form with her dark long hair.

Level 1 had many a lot of paintings and it took us more than 2 hours just to cover the first level. We were getting tired and wanted to other famous paintings, the one marked in the map. We got to level 2, and voila! Van Gogh was there. No, I mean his paintings were there. Van Gogh belonged to the Post-Impressionism period. Though Post-Impressionism is similar to Impressionism, one of the many differences is impressionists gave too much importance to the subject, while post-impressionists showed their emotions and feelings in their paintings.

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/619/32270431175_e76dbf887d_b.jpg" title="Portrait de l’Artiste, 1889 by Van Gogh" >}}

The above painting is a self portrait by Van Gogh. To me, he looks very handsome and somewhat angry and there is something going on in his mind…probably that’s why so many swirl and rave in the background.

On level 2, we also found the work of Rodin. Auguste Rodin was one of the greatest sculptors, whose subject was always the human body.

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/476/32150832081_66712495e6_b.jpg" title="Ugolino by Auguste Rodin" >}}

The above picture of the sculptor by Rodin is from Dante’s The Divine Comedy, where Ugolino is with his sons in a prison. He is watching them die and as he is going crazy with hunger, he is eating his sons’ flesh before dying.

From level 2, we went all the way to level 5 called Nouvel Orsay, the top floor. This floor has all the world renowned paintings from the Impressionism era, and if you are tight on time, you should cover this area first.

I love this painting and no wonder it is one of the most famous paintings in the world. It shows good old happy summer days with delightful mixture of colors.

The Walking Man is a bronze sculptor. This man has no head or hand but he speaks with his body.

Saw this while coming back from the fifth floor. Interesting piece of work. Eh!

And also this.

You can find this seductive piece of work in the grand center aisle of the ground floor.

If you are an art lover, visit this museum. If you are not an art lover, visit this museum. Be here and enjoy the art of the 1800s and early 1900s.
