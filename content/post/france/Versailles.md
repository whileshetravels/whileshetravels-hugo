Versailles is one of the most exquisite palaces of the world and a clear example of how pretentious kings used to be in the past. Started as a hunting lodge by Louis XIII in 1623, the Sun King, Louis XIV spent a great deal of money to convert his dad’s lodge into a grand palace.

If you ask anyone for a day trip from Paris, Versailles would be the number one answer. It took us about an hour to get there. We took RER C from St. Michel-Notre Dam ( a metro station in Paris) and got off at Gare de Versailles-Chantiers. If you are in Paris, you have to take RER C from one of their stations. We had our monthly navigo pass and therefore, we did not buy have to buy any ticket. If you do not own it, a round trip to Versailles would cost you 7.10 euros. To reach the Château from the Versailles train station, turn right out of the station and then make left at the first boulevard and walk for 10 minutes or just follow everyone else.

We did not buy the tickets before hand because winter rules. Being here in summer is challenging with tons of people. So, buy your tickets beforehand from the [official website] (http://en.chateauversailles.fr/). If you have a museum pass, you don’t have to worry about buying any ticket. Avoid Tuesdays and weekends according to the website. The Château costs 18 euros/person (audio guide included) and if you want to go to the Trianon Palaces and Domaine de Marie-Antoinetter too, it would cost you 20 euros. We opted out just for the Château and the garden was free that day. It is not free on Spectacle days when there are events going on there at the garden.

We visited the king and queens’ living quarters, Hercules Drawing Room, Venus Room, Mercury Room, Mars Room, Apollo Room, War Room, and the famous Hall of Mirrors. Each of those rooms had their own charms and my favorite just like everyone else’s was the Hall of Mirrors though I was kind of disappointed when I did not find the mirrors shiny and clean. I loved the big chandeliers here though. What a sight it must be during the the reign of Louis XIV and other kings.

I also liked the statue of Louis XIV in Venus Room. That man had so much swag. He really wanted to be the God. This room also celebrates the marriage of Louis XIV to Marie-Therese in the form of ceiling paintings.

And I really envy the Sun King’s canopied bed in the Mercury Room.

After finishing the palace, we made our way to the lavish garden fill of statues, artificial ponds and green cones. The view of the palace from the garden is grand.

Another interesting spot in the garden not to be missed is Latona Basin, which is a round fountain. Latona is a goddess in Roman mythology. This is a perfect opportunity to take pictures as everything looks splendid from here.

We spent an hour walking around in the garden. Yes, it is big. So, come prepared to do a lot of walking. We skipped the Trianon Palaces and Domaine de Marie-Antoinette, which was an escape palace for Louis XIV as the palace of Versailles got really busy. At this point, we were super hungry and was able to find a nice inexpensive crepe place called Creperie Royale thanks to Yelp reviews. We had both sweet and savory crepes and it was delicious and wonderful service too.

The train station was about half an hour from that crepe place. We could have taken a bus or a train but we decided to run rather. And it was drizzling. Haha. Such a unique experience. We made it in 15 minutes and took the train RER C back to Paris.

I have been to quite a few palaces in Europe and after visiting the one in Versailles, I can understand why they call Versailles the palace of all the palaces in Europe. Go and see it for yourself.
