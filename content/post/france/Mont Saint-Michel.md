Le Mont Saint-Michel, an island commune in Normandy, is one of the most popular day trips from Paris and obviously, we had our heart set on it long before we came to Paris. It is situated in the middle of the bay and is famous for its abbey and having been to [Etretat](http://whileshetravels.com/post/france/%C3%A9tretat/), another commune in Normandy, I was super excited for Mont Saint-Michel. I am sorry I got no picture to show and don’t want to use any Google image.

There is no direct train to Mont Saint-Michel, which is frustrating. After doing a ton of research on how to get to Mont Saint-Michel from Paris, we decided to take this route: TGV train from Paris (station Montparnasse) to Rennes and then a bus from Rennes to Mont Saint Michel for 83 euros/person. We were ready to do the booking at [sncf website](https://en.voyages-sncf.com/en/).  We had entered all the information (Paris to Mont Saint Michel) and confirmed our purchase. We waited an hour to get the tickets in our email and even checked our bank account but no transaction was processed. We tried one more time and noticed this time that SNCF wanted to confirm with our bank that the transaction was not some kind of fraud visa a text message and since our bank account was linked to our US phone which is not in service presently, we did not get any text message.

Hmm. What do we do now? D suggested that we go to an SNCF office and purchase tickets from there. We made an appointment for the next day at 3:40 PM with the closest SNCF office. Next day we got late to our appointment as D got delayed due to his meeting with his manager. We made it there by 4 PM. We got a waiting ticket and our number came in about a minute. The lady who helped was nice, spoke a little English, but we were shocked by the price of the same ticket we saw online. She told us it would cost 120 euros per person and we were like how is it possible. When we checked online it was only 75. She said we would have to buy the ticket online then. So, we gave up on that point and thought of going somewhere else on Sunday.

When we got home that evening, rather than looking for a new destination for our Sunday’s day trip from Paris, I searched about the credit card issue with SNCF. I found out that others did go through the same problem and one person had used [trainline website](https://www.trainline.eu/search) successfully. I gave it a try as well and voila! It worked..partially. So, our transaction was processed only for one leg of the journey and it said try again for the remaining leg. Man, I was scared and pissed thinking if it does not work, we won’t be able to return the purchased ticket as that part of the journey was non-refundable. I tried again and it went through. What a relief! We did not get our tickets right away though, but we knew it’s been processed. After an hour, our tickets were in our email and we were really looking forward to our journey, especially the TGV train part. It was Friday that day.

Now comes Saturday night. We had just come back from our pleasant Latin Quarter walk and a delicious dinner. I set the alarm for 6:45 AM as our train was at 9:08 AM. I woke up not by the sound of my alarm, but by myself. It hit me up right away we overslept. I checked my phone and found out it was turned off. I wanted to sue Apple then..i really did. My phone has been acting up like that lately but only when I take a lot of pictures. It is not an old phone. Only been 14 months. When you pay 700 dollars for a phone, you expect it to work efficiently at least for 2 years. D checked the time on his laptop and it was 8:20. Too late. The train station, Montparnasse is about half an hour from my place and then we had to print out the tickets too from SCNF self service machine. It was impossible to make it. I got on my laptop right away and canceled the refundable-tickets. We were refunded 66 euros. We ended up losing 100 euros not to mention losing hope on my iphone too.  So much for going above and beyond to get tickets only to be betrayed by an Apple phone.

So, if you wanna go to Mont Saint Michel from Paris, you can take one of these two ways:

* High speed TGV train from Paris Montparnasse to Rennes and then a bus from Rennes to Mont Saint Michel. Book this entire journey at [SNCF website](https://en.voyages-sncf.com/en/) or if there is an issue with your credit card like we had, you can use [Trainline website](https://www.trainline.eu/search). The total journey takes 3.5 hours one way.

* Regional train from Paris St. Lazare to Pontorson and then a bus from Pontorson to Mont St. Michel. This option won’t work if you want to do a day trip to Mont Saint Michel as it takes about 5 hours.
