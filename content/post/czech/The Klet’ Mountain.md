The Klet’ mountain is located near [Cesky Krumlov] (http://whileshetravels.com/post/czech/c%CC%8Cesky%CC%81-krumlov/), in the Southern Bohemian region of Czech Republic. Klet’ mountain is about 3556 feet/1084 meters, and you could see the Alps if the weather permits. Basically, it is perfect for connecting with the nature and you could observe the beautiful countryside from the top.

Initially we had planned to go to Ceske Budejovice from Cesky Krumlov, but we both have missed the nature/hiking part so much, we decided it is time for a mountain.We did not have a lot of time to do the actual hiking (what a shame I know), so, we decided to take the chair lift/seated cable railway. We had never been on a chair lift before, at least not the one they used here. So, it was fun in a way.

So, getting here was a little tricky. We took a train from Cesky Krumlov to Holubov, which is a 15 minute ride more or less.

We reached Holubov at 11:15 AM and were aiming to get the chairlift at 12 PM. Chairlift runs every hour. From Holubov, we walked to a small village called Krasetin, which took us about 20 minutes. Give yourself more time as the view of the village is outstanding.

After reaching Krasetin, we were not sure how to reach the chair lift place. Luckily, we found someone and he was able to speak English, he told us to follow the White-Green-White signs on trees, fences, etc, and we would be able to get there.

We walked and walked and we could still not the sign of the chair lift place. We were afraid we might miss our chairlift at 12 PM. At 11:50 AM, we saw a parking lot and there was a man there who was friendly, but could hardly speak English. He called up the chairlift office for us and the lady on the phone told us to walk up 200 meters more. We had 5 minutes to do so, and it was an uphill. I had walked so much, I was unable to run. D was getting a little agitated, but we made it. Phew!! We got onto the chairlift. It costs 110 CZK/person or 4.5 euros two way. Not bad.

You have to get on the chair as soon as it arrives. I did not do that and missed my first chair. The chairlift might feel unsafe as it is really open and your legs would be in open, but trust me, it is a fun ride. I loved it every moment. It took us about 20 minutes from the chairlift to get to the top.

Our first stop after reaching the top was the restaurant there, which was filled up with locals. After waiting for 10-15 minutes,we managed to get a table. D was still upset because we had to run and all, but we talked that it is impossible to have a perfect plan for everything and then we ordered the food. We had fried mozzarella cheese on bread with french fries, and I had a cappuccino. It was delicious.

We went to the observatory tower, which costs 20 CZK/person. The view from the tower of Southern Bohemia is astonishing. It was a little chilly, but nothing we could not handle.

We had to take the chairlift at 2PM and we still had sometime to wander around.

We saw people and even small children hiking up.

Our train to Cesky Budejovice was at 3:08 PM, and we made it to Holubov station easily this time. There were sheep, horses and cows around the farm.

The Klet’ mountain was a good break from all the sightseeing we have been doing. If you wanna get away from the town and enjoy the beauty of the nature of Czech, this is the place to be. You can find more information about the Klet’ [here](http://www.ckrumlov.info/docs/en/atr335.xml).
