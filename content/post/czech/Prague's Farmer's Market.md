If you are here in Prague for a good amount of days, you must visit one of the **farmer’s market** held on Saturdays at Square I.P. Pavlova, Square Jiriho z Podebrad or at the riverbank near Palackeho namesti. It is a great way to enjoy the atmosphere, meet locals, and taste local food.

D and I decided to go to **Naplavka Farmer’s market**, which is right on the Vltava riverbank. The address is Náplavka, 128 00 Praha 2. You can reach here by tram 10, 16, 2, or 7. You could also take train line B. It is at a great location with wonderful views.

We reached here around 9:30 AM on a cold December morning and it was still crowded. There were so many stalls to choose from. The atmosphere was sort of festive.

The first we had was a chocolate crepe with nuts for 80 CZK. It was simple and delicious. You must try hot cider during winter. It is yummy and warms you quickly. They also have cold cider in case you are visiting during summer. It is a great local produce. We also bought an orange-apricot marmalade after trying out a bunch of various marmalades.

Our favorite food stall. We had boiled potatoes with cheese, picked cucumber, mushrooms, thyme, and black and red pepper. So delicious.

 There were two men selling these cakes. We were just looking around initially and one of them asked us if we wanna try them. He gave us the sample of all the cakes he was selling: carrot and beetroot cake, chocolate cake and blueberry cake. He did not have a full slice of carrot and beetroot cake. So, he gave us for half the price for 40 CZK. Yayy! Cool Czech people.

We left around 11 am and it got really crowded then. So, if you plan to go, and I suggest you must, be there as early as possible.
