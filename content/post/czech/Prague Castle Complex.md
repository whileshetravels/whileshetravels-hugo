If you are in Prague and have not visited the castle, have you really been to Prague? The answer is no. Yes, we waited like forever to visit the famous castle for some unknown reason, but nonetheless, we did it and guess what we were rewarded with for our patience? Snow and a lot of it. Prague Castle is not just a castle but a castle complex and the largest one too in the world with an area of almost 70,000 meter squares.

We left early around 9 AM and took metro line A to Malostranská (look at the castle map below) and then it was a 9 minute walk from there and before entering the actual castle complex, we were able to see the views of the roofs of the Lesser Town. Be prepared to undergo a security check as the Czech government works from here.

There are different types of tickets to choose from and the most popular one is Prague Castle Circuit-B, which gives you access to the important sights like Old Royal Palace, St. George’s Basilica, and Golden Lane with Daliborka Tower. It costs 250 CZK/person. Tickets are good for two days in a row, something which I liked for people who wanna return to the castle next day. There are several locations here to buy the tickets from. We got our tickets, type circuit-B from the information center in the second courtyard. Tickets are also sold in the Prague Castle Picture Gallery, the Old Royal Palace and at two ticket offices in the Golden Lane. We also bought two separate tickets (not included with our circuit B type ticket) for the The Great South Tower of St. Vitus Cathedral for 70 CZK/person.

We started with visiting The Great South Tower of St. Vitus Cathedral. The tower was founded around 1396 based on plans by Peter Parler, and this tower challenged our physical abilities. There are 286 steps, and they are tight and small and windy and more than 90 meters high. We were losing our patience but the view from the top made us realize it was totally worth it to climb up all those ridiculous steps.

Also, inside the tower, there is the biggest bell in Czech Republic weighing about 15 tons, which predicted the disastrous flood in Prague in 2002. How? Its clapper cracked which is a bad sign. Interesting. Right?

Our next stop was the Old Royal Palace which is designed in the Gothic and Renaissance styles. Honestly, this palace is nothing like the ones I saw in other countries in Europe. I guess the kings were modest and did not want to spend much money or something like that.

There is nothing extraordinary here and the building is mostly empty and confusing. At times, we were not even sure where to go next. If you do not buy a comprehensive circuit A or B ticket, this could be skipped easily.

The next on line was St. Vitus Cathedral and that place was everything I had expected it to be.

 Magnificent, crowded and dominating the castle in every way possible, it is the most important church in Czech. Its architecture is Gothic style.

The cathedral is huge and its stained glass windows are beautiful. You gotta visit this in order to appreciate its beauty. You could enter it without any ticket but the access is limited then. You won’t be able to see other interesting parts of the cathedral but can definitely take pictures.

And another one..

Our next stop was St. George’s Basilica and that was when D lost one of the tickets. He had both our tickets in his pocket. The guy at the entrance gate believed us because we look genuine, you know. Ha. But he said it would be impossible to enter the Golden lane, our last destination, and he was true, sadly.

St. George’s Basilica is a small plane respectful church. It has two staircases which gives it a rich look. Its exterior is beautiful and it gives a decent competition to the St. Vitus Cathedral by its red Baroque facade.

St. George’s Basilica from inside is very boring compared to the St. Vitus Cathedral, but you might want to visit inside even for few minutes as it is the part of the ticket A/B.

We did try our luck at the Golden Lane, but could not get in though one of us could have as we still had one ticket, but we decided none of us would visit it and we were okay with it.

The Prague Castle Complex was like a fairytale town during snow and I am so glad I waited until the very last day to visit this wonderful place.
