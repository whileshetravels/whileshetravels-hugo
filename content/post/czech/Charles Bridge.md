Charles Bridge is one of the most popular attractions in Prague. I don’t know what it is but there is something unique in the atmosphere on this bridge. It is too lively and everyone is super happy.

Charles Bridge was built under Charles IV in 1357 and completed in 1402. It was built to replace the old Judith bridge which was destroyed during flood in 1342.

We visited the bridge after completing our tour of the Prague Castle Complex and that’s what most people do as it is close by. Alternatively, you could also take tram 22 or metro line A to Malostranska.

Like the one here with a bird on her head..okay that’s a real bird and not a statue.

Charles Bridge is called Karlov Most in Czech and this is the evidence.

And the beautiful Vltava river..

Walking around the bridge is a unique experience in itself. I visited the bridge twice and it was a surreal feeling both the times. In order to beat the crowd, go as early as possible when you can have the bridge to yourself or pretty late. Charles Bridge should not be missed while in Prague.
