To be honest, I donâ€™t have any idea about hotels in Prague as we never stayed at any of them. We were going to be in Prague for more than a month (33 nights) and needed a furnished apartment/studio where we could live somewhat like locals.

We did an extensive research on different websites and were able to find a great studio in an excellent location for 24,000 CZK for 33 nights at https://www.expats.cz/. The same studio is listed on Airbnb too, but it was more expensive due to airbnb fee. The studio has everything to make you feel you are at home. There are a lot of cafes around, public transportation is close by, and there are two super markets close by. If you are interested in this apartment, I can give you the email of the owner and you may contact her directly. Her name is Jana and she is a wonderful lady, and her price is very reasonable. I am listing down the other websites where you could look for both short term and long term rentals in Prague:

https://www.expats.cz/
http://www.appartamento.cz/
https://www.bezrealitky.cz/
www.sreality.cz
https://www.airbnb.com/
https://www.homeaway.com/

If you have any more question about staying in Prague or about the studio we stayed at, feel free to ask me. I would be happy to help.
