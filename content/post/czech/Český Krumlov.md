Český Krumlov is a small fairy tale town in Czech Republic and can be done as a day trip from Prague, if you are okay commuting for 6 hours round trip by train/bus, but if you could spend a night here, just like we did, you would be just blown away.

We took an early train at 8:02 AM to Cesky Krumlov from Prague and reached there at 10:50 AM. You could easily take a bus by Student Agency or some other company too to reach there.

We were hungry and wanted to grab a quick breakfast before starting our exploration. We stopped by at Omnes Caffe Arelta. I had their nutella and banana sandwich along with hot chocolate, and D had cranberry and cheese sandwich. Delicious.

### ČESKÝ KRUMLOV CASTLE

If you could visit only one place in Český Krumlov, [Český Krumlov Castle] (https://www.zamek-ceskykrumlov.eu/en/plan-your-visit/opening-hours) it has to be. The castle if pretty big compared to the size of Český Krumlov itself.

The castle was built around the end of the 13th century by the Lords of the Krumlov branch of the Witigonen family. Though the castle started in Gothic style, it was finished in Renaissance style. We first started with climbing up the tower of the castle. It is a little challenging, but nothing you can’t do.

You could see the entire town from the top along with the courtyard and Vltava river. The only regret we have is that the castle was closed when we were there (December 17, 2016). Also, the garden was not open either, but it was fine. The view from the top of the tower was worth it.

We also visited the Castle museum, which was opened in 2011 by the National Heritage Institute. The museum depicts the lifestyle and the important events related to the various owners of the castle.

And also by him…Haha. That’s how the guards used to look like.

It’s time for lunch and we were in the mood for pizza. We had vegetable pizza at Nona Gina. The place is in the center. Was not difficult to find.

We were once again ready to explore the rest of the city after getting filled up.

### CHURCH OF ST. VITUS

Church of St. Vitus is the second most important landmark of Cesky Krumlov after the castle. It is situated in the center too and you could easily walk there.

The Church of St. Vitus was built in the 14th century in Gothic style and it is still used for the religious purposes. We were there for about 15 minutes, and it felt so peaceful.

### HISTORIC CENTER OF THE TOWN

Cesky Krumlov is such a beautiful town, you do not need to be at a specific place in order to enjoy its beauty. We just wandered around and the crowd was just right. The weather was chilly, but that still did not stop us from appreciating this beautiful town.

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4201/34891219956_952751163a_b.jpg" title="The castle is visible from everywhere from the center" >}}

I also came around a telephone booth. How interesting!

And once again, we were rewarded with the christmas market for visiting this beautiful town during a cold weather. We had cinnamon trdlo, something I had been wanting to eat since a long time.

### KLET’ MOUNTAIN

Initially we had planned to go to Ceske Budejovice from Cesky Krumlov, but we both have missed the nature/hiking part so much, we decided it is time for a mountain. Klet mountain is about 3556 feet/1084 meters, and you could see the Alps if the weather permits.

People do hike from Cesky Krumlov, but if you do not have a lot of time, like us, you could go take a train to Holubov and get to the summit from there. There is so much to write about how we got to the Klet’, I have to write a separate post for it. You can read more about Klet’ [here] (http://whileshetravels.com/post/czech/the-klet-mountain/).

Cesky Krumlov is a charming romantic town. It is modern with an old touch. No wonder it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
