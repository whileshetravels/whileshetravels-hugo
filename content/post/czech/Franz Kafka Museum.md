“I am a cage, in search of a bird.” ― Franz Kafka

I read “Metamorphosis” by Franz Kafka in the summer of 2013 and honestly, I had never read a book like that. It did not make much sense to me and yet kept me intrigued. All that time I was reading, I kept on thinking what the hell the writer was thinking while writing this book. I had no idea who Kafka was then. I just knew he was the author of the book I was reading, and at the end of the book, I was completely stumped by this book . When I came to know there is a Kafka museum in Prague, I knew what I had to do. D admires him equally and he is the only person I know who has read Kafka’s work. So, there was no problem there visiting the museum.

Franz Kafka museum is located in Mala Strana, Prague 1. There are many other attractions too in Mala Strana about which I have written in my other post. We took the metro, line A and got off at Malostranská and it is a 4 minute walk from there. Alternatively, you could also take tram 22 to Malostranská. It is super close to the Charles bridge. So, the first thing you encounter outside the museum shop is a weirdly interesting sculpture in a fountain called ‘ The Piss Sculpture”.

We bought the tickets from the museum shop for 200 CZK/person, but I later found out that if you buy your tickets from the Mucha musuem, you get it for 100 CZK. Oh well, next time.

The museum is divided into two parts: Existential space and Imaginary topography. Existential space is all about the impact Prague had on the author and imaginary topography is about how Prague was present through out his literature. The museum has a dark unique setting to indicate the troubled mind of this genius writer. There are lot of his first edition books, his letters to his father, which depicts his complicated relationship with him, his diaries entries, manuscripts, and original cover pages of his work.There are many quotes but unfortunately, most of them are in German. The only downside of the museum, but the rest of the exhibition is translated in English. So, no worries. Also, you can’t take pictures here, which is a good thing. Trust me.

The Franz Kafka is a small museum which could be done in an hour or less. It goes without saying that if you know Prague as the city of K, you must visit this museum. You would fall in love with both Kafka and Prague more.
