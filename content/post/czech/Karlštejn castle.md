There is no shortage of castles in Czech Republic and one of the castles you might wanna add to your list is Karlštejn castle. Why? Because the village it is located at, also called Karlštejn, is amazingly beautiful and also, it is only 30 Km or 19 miles from Prague. It could easily be a half day trip from Prague. Founded in mid 1300, nobody knows who actually built it. Strange. Eh!

We took a train from Praha hl.n. at 9:17 AM and reached Karlštejn at 9:57 AM. A 40 minute ride basically. It is about half an hour walk from the Karlštejn train station to the Karlštejn castle.We had no trouble finding it because we found the direction to the castle everywhere. The castle is situated on a hill in a forest setting, but the walk is pretty smooth, and I loved it. You can also take horse carriages up to the hill, which I am sure must be fun too.

We were there on a Friday morning and during winter, the castle opens only on weekends. Yes, we knew it and still decided to go because I had read many reviews that the tour of the castle ain’t good and also the tower for the view from the top is completely closed in winter. We just wanted to view the castle from the outside and enjoy the authentic Czech village. There were very few people and it seemed the whole village was left out to us.

We saw a ton of restaurants/cafes but most of them were closed as the castle itself was closed. We did manage to find a small bakery shop. There was an old lady there who was sweet, but did not know English as we did not know Czech, but we were still able to converse with her. That’s one of the best parts in traveling in a country where you have to struggle to have conversations with others. Exceptions applied. Lol.

I can not stress enough how beautiful this village is. I can not comment on the interior of the castle but Karlštejn is worth visiting. This village is full of life in summer with many restaurants and cafes around. There are even hotels here too. And if you are here during winter, like us, you would still be able to enjoy the village and the castle, all by yourself, probably.
