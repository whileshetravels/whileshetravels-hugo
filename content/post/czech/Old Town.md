If you want to travel back in time, say no more. Old Town in Prague will take you to the medieval times. This place is full of tourists as you would have guessed already. Therefore, D and I decided to leave early around 8:30 AM on a December morning. Yes, it was cold. We walked to the old town as it was only a 20 minute walk from our place.

### OLD TOWN HALL TOWER

“To see Prague from “bird’s eye view”, visit the Old Town Hall tower.”
Our first stop was Old Town Hall Tower. We wanted to climb up  before getting super crowded. If you are going on Monday, you might wanna go late as the tower opens at 11 AM and closes at 6 PM and the rest of the day, its hours is from 9AM to 10 PM. There is an entrance fee of 130 CZK which is nothing compared to the view you get from the top.

The old town tower was completed in the 14th century. We took the stairs to reach the top as there were pictures explaining the history of the place, but if you are not up for taking stairs, you could take the elevator/lift too. The view from the top is spectacular. You get to see the center of Prague and its suburbs.

Even though there were people around me including D, the beauty of the top view makes you feel serene and kind of connected to yourself in a way, which only you can understand.

### ASTRONOMICAL CLOCK

Astronomical Clock is built in to one side of the Old Town Hall Tower dating back to the 15th century.

We joined the crowd to watch the movement of twelve apostles and other figures on the Astronomical Clock. Every hour, they appear at the two small windows. There is also a skeleton of Death which rings a bell to indicate to the Turk that his time is up.

It’s too advanced for its time. It has different parts including the astronomical and calendar faces. Maintaining it was not always easy and required a lot of money in the past. The basic structure of the clock is pretty much the same as the Middle Ages.

### JAN HUS MONUMENT

Jan Hus was a Czech Priest, philosopher and a Protestant reformer. He was executed which lead to the Hussite war. The monument of Jan Hus is situated in the center of the Old Town Square. It was erected on July 6, 1915 to mark the 500th anniversary of the reformer’s death.

### ST. NICHOLAS’ CHURCH

Though this church is not as famous as the one in Lesser Town, it still is pretty beautiful. There are many musical concerts held here too.

### OLD TOWN SQUARE

The Old Town Square is the oldest and the most important squares of Prague. It is such a lively place full of both locals and tourists. There are many restaurants, pubs, souvenirs shops, entertainment, galleries and museums. Visiting it during Christmas time just adds icing to the cake.

We went back to the Old town square, this time at night, and God, what a crowd. It was a full house. There was barely any space to walk, but I loved it. Totally different from what we had experienced during our day visit, and my favorite church, Church of our Lady before Tyn looked even more stunning.

Just walk around the Old Town and you will come across many hidden gems. The southern part of Old Town consists of mainly narrow cobblestone streets and arcaded courtyards. It is a must see while in Prague. Just be in your comfortable shoes and explore this part of Prague.
