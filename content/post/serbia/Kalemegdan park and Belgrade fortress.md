Kalemegdan Park is the Central Park of Belgrade, which means it is the largest and most beautiful park in Belgrade. It name comes from two Turkish words: Kale meaning fortress and megdan meaning battlefield. Kalemegdan park is basically a part of the Belgrade fortress and if there is only one thing you could do in Belgrade, it has to be visiting this fortress along with the park.

**HISTORY OF THE BELGRADE FORTRESS**

Belgrade fortress is as old as the city Belgrade itself, therefore, super rich in history. It was built during a long period of time from the 2nd to the 18th century, being destroyed and rebuilt several times in the process. The first fortification was done by the Romans in the 2nd century, which later became home to the Roman legion IV Flaviae which protected the area. It was then occupied by the Slavs and by the end of the 9th century, it was already known to contemporaries as Beograd. Later it fell into the hands of Turks until the year 1867, when the Turks withdrew from Belgrade and Serbia.  During the short period of Austrian rule (1718–1738), the fortress was largely rebuilt and modernized.

**WHAT TO DO IN THE PARK AND THE FORTRESS**

Both the fortress and the park are huge. We spend a lot of time walking around. Reaching the top of the fortress, you get a bird's-eye view of the two rivers, Danube and Sava, the New Belgrade and the Zemun quarters to the west and the vast areas to the north of the city.

One of the most famous landmarks of this fortress and the city of Belgrade is the **Victor monument** also known as Pobednik. Located in the upper part of the Belgrade fortress, it was built in 1928 to celebrate the victory of Serbia over Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empire during the Balkan Wars and the WW1.

The Upper Town of the fortress also contains the Military Museum and the first Masonic temple in Belgrade, which presently serves as the Gallery of the Natural History Museum.

One of my favorite spots in this fortress is the **Ružica Church**. It is a small beautiful chapel hidden in a corner away from the crowd. We sat down here for a moment contemplating and soaking up the atmosphere.

**Tip**: *Visit the Upper Town of the fortress during the sunset.*

We were in belgrade for 2 weeks and therefore, we visited the fortress and the park few times. The best time to visit it right before the sunset. Grab some snacks and find a spot to sit at the Upper Town of the fortress and watch the sun setting over the city of Belgrade. It was so beautiful we came back here again for two days in a row. There were a good amount of people, young and old, enjoying this wonderful view. In summer, it gets real crowded with both locals and tourists.

**Kalemegdan Park** was developed as late as 19th century featuring many sculptures, Cvijeta Zuzorić Art Pavilion, an amusement park, a zoo, and above all a place for everyone to just chill and relax. If you are looking for souvenirs, you can buy one here.

Spend at least 2-3 hours at the Kalemegdan fortress park. It is not something unique and out of the world, but watching the sunset over the confluence of the Sava and Danube is splendid, but then sunsets everywhere are beautiful. :) Right after the sunset, you could see Belgrade embraced in the lights and I have to say, I was impressed how beautiful it looked.
