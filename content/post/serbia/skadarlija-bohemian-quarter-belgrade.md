Skadarlija is a vintage street close to the city center of Belgrade. It is also called Bohemian quarter similar to Paris’ Montmartre. Though it is not as bohemian in nature as it was once, it has still maintained its old atmosphere and spirit to some extent and you can find cobblestone pavements here.

This	street	is	named	after	the	old	Serbian	town	Skadar, which is on	the	territory	of	Albania today. Skadarlija started transforming into a bohemian quarter when a famous kafana/tavern called Dardaneli on Republic Square was closed and Serbian poets, painters, artists moved to Skadarlija’s inns/kafanas.

You can still visit some restaurants like Three Hats, My Hat, Two Deer and Golden Chalice where you can get authenrit Serbian food, from the old time where Serbian artists would sit down and discuss about life, arts, and politics.

Strolling down the road, we saw the house	of	the	famous Serbian	poet	Djuro	Jaksic. We saw his statue at the Danube Park in Novi Sad too. He must be some hot shot. Today it has been converted into a gathering point for poets participating in the Skadarlija Evenings event and even you can go inside for free.

There is a famous sibilj fountain at the end of the street, which is a replica of the fountain in Sarajevo’s Old Town.

Skadarlija is a perfect place to go back to the old times and experience how Belgrade used to be 100-200 years ago. With its short cobblestones street, authentic Serb food serving restaurants, various monuments of famous people who used to visit this place, it makes a perfect getaway from all the modernization momentarily.

*“My name is Skadarlija…or Skadarska street, however you like it. I am no boulevard….or avenue.…or highway. I am a common steep curved alley in the middle of Belgrade. And that would be everything meaningful to be told about me if it wouldn’t be for my bohemian history, my crumbling roofs, my shaking chairs…”* - Zuko Dzumhur
