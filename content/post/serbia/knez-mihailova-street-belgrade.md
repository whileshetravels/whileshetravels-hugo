This is one of the busiest streets I have seen and I have seen quite a few busy streets. There are tons and tons of people and this was in March. It must a beautiful mad place in summer. On my very first day, I saw someone playing tennis in the middle of the street..that’s how you know you are in the country of Djokovic.

Knez	Mihailova	Street is the best place to absorb the atmosphere of the happening city of Belgrade. With so many restuarants/cafes to choose from and a handful of international brands to shop from, you would love it unless you happen to not like a crowded street.
