Republic Square is one of the most common meeting points for both locals and visitors. If you are going on a tour with a local tour company, they would ask you to meet them “Under the Horse” which is just another name for Republic Square. Why? Because of the Monument to Prince Mihailo Obrenovic.

Besides the statue of Prince Mihailo, you can also find the National Museum and the National Theatre at Republic Square.

Republic Square is something  you can’t miss. It is considered as the center of Belgrade. If you are in Knez Mihailova	Street, you would definitely stumble into the “Horse Statue” and in case you don’t, just ask someone. People in Belgrade speak pretty good English.
