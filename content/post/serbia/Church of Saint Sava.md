The Church of Saint Sava, dedicated to Saint Sava, is one of the largest Orthodox churches in the world and the largest in the Balkans, located on the Vračar plateau in Belgrade. It is a pretty impressive church, looking majestic from the outside with its bright white walls, golden crosses and plump domes, but going inside, you feel a little disappointed as it is not completed yet. It is called the Basílica de la Sagrada Familia of Barcelona for obvious reasons.

Saint Sava remains were burnt down by the Ottomans in 1595 when Serb rebels rose against them. Fast forward 300 years, plans were laid out to build a temple on the place of the burning. The construction finally began 40 years after the plan in 1935. Construction was delayed couple of times because of Balkan and World War 1 and finally started before World War 2, which again got interrupted. After World War 2, communists stopped the Church from further construction and have used semi-finished construction as parking lot. The construction is still going on thanks to healthy donations from Russia and other private ones. Once complete, this should be one of the most beautiful churches in the world.
