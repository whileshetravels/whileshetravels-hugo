Nikola Tesla is my all time favorite scientists and if you are into science, I am sure you admire him too. For those people who don't know much about Tesla, he was born in a Serbian family in a Croatian town of Smiljan in 1856. This is the reason why both Serbia and Croatia are so proud of him. In Serbia, he is like everywhere from Tesla TV to Tesla 100 Dinar bill. He moved to New York, US and worked for Thomas Alva Edison, but the two did not get along well. Tesla invented a bunch of stuff from designing of the modern alternating current electricity supply system to wireless energy transfer. So, if you are able to charge your phone, use any kind of wireless devices, or sitting under florescent lights thank this man, and yes, visit his museum if you happen to be in Belgrade.

### VISITING THE MUSEUM

When we visited the [museum](http://www.nikolateslamuseum.org/web/page.php?p=4&s=32&l=en), we did not know anything about the guided tour. We got lucky there was a tour in English taking place at that time and we joined them after paying 500 Dinars/person for ticket. Tours start at the beginning of every hour and depending on the wishes of the visitors, tour can be either in Serbian or English. You can call ahead Mon-Fri from 9 to 3:30 at +381 011 2433886 to find out about when English/Serbian is available.

**Tip**: *Make reservations ahead of time especially during summer as only limited number of people can enter.*

### THE MUSEUM

The museum is not big and can get kinda crowded. Nonetheless, it's a very interesting museum with good representations about Nikola Tesla's life. The tour not only allows you to see the machine, but also participate in small fun demonstrations.

I got out of the museum well informed about one of the greatest minds ever lived. I have to warn you though. This museum won't be that much fun without the tour as you won't get to see and participate in different demonstrations including the Tesla Coil Exhibit.

I feel the museum could do better and bigger but if you are a fan of Tesla or Science, it's worth stopping by. Just don't forget to find out the schedule of the guided tour.
