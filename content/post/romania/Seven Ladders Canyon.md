Our Airbnb host suggested us to hike to the Seven Ladders Canyon also known Canionul Sapte Scari in Romania. 7 Laderrs Canyon lies in Piatra Mare Mountains and if you enjoy hiking and some adrenaline rush, this is the place you need to be. Many people visiting Brasov don’t know about it, but it is pretty popular with locals. We were staying for a total of 10 days in Brasov and we thought why not, let’s do some hiking, which would be a good change from all the sightseeings we’d been doing. And I am so glad we did this because it truly was a unique experience for me and my husband.

### HOW TO REACH THE TRAILHEAD OF THE SEVEN LADDERS CANYON FROM BRASOV

In winter (October-April), they are open only during weekends, but in summer, they are open everyday.  We didn’t have a car. So, obviously we opted for the public transport. We took bus number 17 B from Brasov train station. Just outside the train station, you would see a lot of buses leaving. Just find bus 17b and get off at Dambul Morii. You can buy bus tickets from a small counter just where you see all the buses lined up. Don’t get on any bus without your ticket. Tickets are checked frequently. So, be careful. Bus 17b is not super frequent and during weekends, it runs every 2 hours or so. Therefore, you gotta plan accordingly. You can find the schedule of buses here. We got on the bus at 11:00 AM an reached Dambul Morii around 11:30 AM. Go to the other side of the highway where you get off the bus and make a right. You wanna go to Piatra Mare street because that’s where the trail starts from.

### HIKING TO THE SEVEN LADDERS CANYON

It took us about an hour to go to the beginning of the canyon. There are two trails marks: yellow and red. You must choose yellow if you wanna reach the canyon. Red one will take you somewhere else and is super challenging and time consuming.

The hike up to the canyon is pleasant. Nothing difficult. Many people just hike up to the canyon but don’t really climb the ladders and experience the canyon. I guess those are locals who have been to the canyon many times already.

After an hour hike, we reached a cabin where we had to pay 10 Lei in order to climb the ladders. So worth it. From the cabin, we walked to the canyon, which took us about 5 minutes, and then the real fun started.

“The canyon has been carved in Jurassic limestone and is composed by seven waterfalls, the tallest being 35 metres (115 ft) high. The trail within the canyon is arranged with metal stairs and platforms.”

Climbing those stairs is not easy especially when you have a big waterfall running next to you. The longest one was 12 meters in length.

I was holding the sides of the stairs and then one of the men from the cabin came and recommended me to hold the steps of the stairs and not the sides. That helped a lot.

**Tip**: *Please wear shoes with good grips.*

As much as those ladders were scary, I enjoyed all of them. It was something I had never done before. Crazy and beautiful experience for me. It took us about 20 minutes to get done with the ladders.

We did not come back from the same route. I can’t imagine climbing down those steps. It would have been too difficult I assume. We followed the red dot mark (it has to be a dot and not a stripe) like shown in the picture below until we reached the ticket cabin and from there it was the same trail as going up, meaning the yellow one.

Going down was not easy for us. There was a lot of snow and it had rained a day before. So, it was really slippery. I felt i am gonna roll down many times, but luckily I was able to make it back to the cabin.

The hike from the cabin to the start of the trail is easy. We made it back at 2:15 PM. It took us a little less than 3 hours altogether.

Our bus back to Brasov wasn’t until 3:43 PM. We tried calling a cab but it didn’t work out. We were hungry and decided to eat at one of the restaurants close by, called 3 STARS. Amazing food and great service but real slow. We almost missed our bus waiting for the food. Had to rush a little to catch our bus, but made it.

I feel 7 ladders canyon should definitely be on your list if you are going to be in Brasov or around. Before coming to Romania, I had no idea Romania had so many cool things to do. And thank you, Bianca, if you are reading this. We wouldn’t have done this had you not told us about the 7 Ladders Canyon. :-)
