Ever since coming to Romania, everybody kept talking about how we have to visit Sighisoara, the only living citadel in Europe. When we were in Sibiu, our guide suggested us to take us there, but we thought we would do this as a day trip from Brasov as we had more days there. In Brasov, one of the first things our Airbnb host told us was to go get lost in Sighisoara. So, we were really pumped up to see what this place holds.

### HOW TO REACH SIGHISOARA FROM BRASOV

Sighisoara is more close to Sibiu than Brasov. If you wanna do it and can do it from Sibiu, you definitely should. Getting there from Brasov is pretty easy but it takes about 2.5-3 hours and sometimes more if your train is running late. We took a train at 8:51 AM from the Brasov train station. Yes, it is pretty early, but there is not much option either. The next train is at 2:30 PM. Buses don’t help either as their schedule is pretty much the same as trains’. We bought our tickets from the counter. Make sure you have cash. They don’t accept credit card. There is an ATM right next to the ticket counters though. So, you should be fine. Romanian trains are super slow. At times, we felt we could just walk and would reach before this train does. Lol. But the scenery is pretty good, which helped us with our ride.

We were supposed to reach around 11:30 AM and got there a little after 12. The old town/citadel is about 15 minutes walk from the train station in Sighisoara. You can find the schedule of trains [here](https://www.cfrcalatori.ro/en).

### HISTORY OF SIGHISOARA

Sighisoara is one of the seven Saxon walled citadels in Transylvania. Brasov and Sibiu being the other two, where we have been. Sighisoara was first inhabited by the the Dacians, who were like Native Americans of Romania. They buit a fortification called Sandava Then came the Romans, and under their administration, it was called  Castrum Stenarum, and finally in the 12th century, Saxons built a new citadel called Schäßburg. Also, if you are looking for Dracula, this is the place you should be because he was born here. You can even visit the house he used to live in. Designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, it is considered one of the most beautiful and best-preserved medieval towns in Europe. It’s another thing my husband and I have a different opinion.

### WHAT TO DO AND SEE IN SIGHISOARA

I have to say this Sighisoara is not worth so much hype. Maybe I was expecting a lot or something. To both of us, it did not look something extraordinary. We visited in April and there was nothing special going on. That could be one of the reasons.

We started with visiting the clock tower, the highlight of Sighisoara. The entrance fee is 15 Lei and I think it’s worth it. As you climb the stairs, there is the history museum, with exhibits on each level. It has many cultural items of Romanian history, but it is skippable if you don’t have a lot of time.

You can see the inner workings of the clock as well on the way up, which is cool. The climb to the top is fairly easy and the view from the top is beautiful. You could see the whole town from here.

It also indicates the distance from it to some big city around the world.

One thing pretty unique about this city was the Scara Acoperita-Covered Stairway. Yes, a stairway. We took this stair to get on the hill. It is like a short hike with 176 steps. Wear comfortable shoes.

The stairs lead to the Church on the hill, where you can have a nice view of the city from above. The stairway, also known as the Schoolboys’ Stairs, was built in the 1642 to help students go to the school located near the Church on the Hill during snow or rain.

After climbing up the stairs, we reached the church on the hill. It is a beautiful gothic church, but kinda similar to other church we have seen in Romania. We did not go inside. The entrance fee is 8 Lei.

After covering these attractions, all we did was wander around. The center is a charming little place.

The architecture, winding cobbled alleys, colorful streets were a delight, but honestly, there is nothing much to do here and you can cover most of the things in about 2 hours or even less.

Our train back to Brasov was at 3:30 PM. We had enough time to grab lunch. There are many restaurants and cafes around. We chose Gasthaus Altepost Pension. It was big and almost empty. Our host was friendly and English speaking. We had grilled chicken with fries, crepes and juices.

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2876/33869101471_b2eee67f2c_b.jpg" title="" >}}

We reached the train station around 3:15. This time our train was right on time and we reached Brasov at 6:40 PM.

If you have a car, Sighisoara should be on your day trip list as it takes only about a hour and half from Brasov, but with train/bus, it is not worth it to go all the trouble of a total of 6 hours commute to see something which does not have a lot to do. Things might be different in summer. So, maybe it’s worth it then or if you happen to have an extra day in Brasov/Sibiu.
