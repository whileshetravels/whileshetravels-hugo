Itâ€™s been 4 months since we left our apartment in San Francisco to travel Europe. We have been to many places, seen a lot of wonderful things, met some really interesting people, but something which we would never forget is the hospitality of Diana and John. We stayed with them for 2 nights at their apartment located centrally in Timisoara via Airbnb. We came as strangers and left as friends.
Both Diana and John are lovely people and they make such a cute couple. They happen to be a long term travelers too. They were on a 3 month trip to different places and having that in common with us, we had just so much to talk about. Both the nights we stayed, we had healthy long conversations about life, travel, culture, traditions and much more.
