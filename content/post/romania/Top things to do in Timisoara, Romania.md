We had heard and read a lot about Romania from the stories of Dracula to this country having one of the fastest internets in the world, and this was on our bucket list since a long time. The first city we decided to explore in Romania was Timisoara as it was only a 3 hour drive from Belgrade, where we stayed for 2 weeks. Timisoara is the third most populous country in Romania and being the European Cultural Capital for 2021, it offers a lot of things to do, and most of the important landmarks are situated in the city center or close to the city center.

### 1. STROLL AROUND THE PARKS IN TIMISOARA

Timisoara used to be called the little Wien thanks to a number of parks in this city, and one of the best times to visit would be spring where you see beautiful flowers of different colors from yellow to pink to white.

My favorite park in Timisoara was Cathedral park right next to the Timisoara Orthodox cathedral. I also loved **Central Park, Justice Park, Botanic Park** and one of the most popular **Roses Park**. There were no roses when I visited but in summer, it is a big deal and real pretty.

If you happen to be here with your partner, Timisoara parks would be the best place to rekindle your romance.

### 2. PAY YOUR VISIT TO THE MAGNIFICENT TIMISOARA ORTHODOX CATHEDRAL

Timisoara Orthodox Cathedral looks like a Disney like cathedral. Built between 1936 and 1941, its architecture is Neo-Moldavian style, based on the elements of Roman orthodox, ottoman, byzantine and late Renaissance. The cathedral has 11 towers, the highest being of length 90.5 meters.  

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2837/33615471031_aca2e7ac0a_b.jpg" title="Looks like a disney iconic castle right?" >}}

The cathedral is located in the city center surrounded by the central square or victory square on one side and a beautiful cathedral park on the other side. It is magnificent from the inside too.

### 3. FEEL THE ATMOSPHERE OF TIMISOARA AT VICTORY SQUARE ALSO KNOWN AS PIATA VICTORIEI

Victory Square is the symbol of the Romanian revolution in December 1989. It is where the early protests occurred and spread to the other parts of Romania, and the people of Timisoara are really proud of it. This revolution resulted in the end of the communist era in Romania. The end was declared from the balcony of the opera house located at the Victory Square. Ironically, this was the same place longtime Communist leader Nicolae Ceaușescu used to give speeches from. He was executed at the end of the revolution.

Situated in the center of the city, you can  find a lot of the main attractions, including Timișoara Orthodox Cathedral, Romanian National Opera House, Timisoara National Theatre and Politehnica University of Timișoara.

We really liked walking around this square. It is one of the best places to feel the atmosphere of the city. There were a lot of cafes and restaurants and also people selling stuff on carts. We had crepes and it was delicious.

{{< figure src="http://i.imgur.com/Zgfz5Ov.jpg" title="" >}}


There is a statue of a wolf with its pubs, which is a replica of the **Lupa Capitolina**, given to Timisoara by the city of Rome in 1926. There is also a famous fountain, known as “**fountain of fish**” built in 1957 in the form of a star with five corners.

### 4. FEEL HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF ROMANIAN HISTORY AT UNIRII SQUARE

Timisoara is one of the most cosmopolitan cities of Romania and you can find the evidence at Unirii Square, where the Roman Catholic and the Serbian Orthodox temples face each other. Though not as lively as Victory Square, its architecture of Baroque style is the most impressive one in Timisoara.

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2819/33587672742_4fb14b09ac_b.jpg" title="The statue of the Holy Trinity at Unirii Square" >}}

{{< figure src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3927/33587673032_76142c4bc9_b.jpg" title="" >}}


There is also a fountain here, which was one of only two water sources in the city.

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2858/33744154355_ebc22d17ea_b.jpg" title="" >}}

Unirii Square is such a unique relaxing place at the heart of the city. You can just sit here with your drink and enjoy the people passing by.

### 5. TASTE THE ART COLLECTION AT THE BAROQUE PALACE

We also visited the Baroque palace close to Unirii Square. The palace is beautiful from both outside and inside. It houses the work of many local artists and is one of important landmarks of Timisoara.

### 6. VISIT THE OLDEST SQUARE OF TIMISOARA, LIBERTATII SQUARE

Libertatii Square is the oldest square in Timisoara. This is the nucleus of the city and this is where people of Timisoara first settled. Though not as famous as the other two squares, it makes the connection between Victory Square and Unirii Square, which means you will walk through this.

{{< figure src="http://i.imgur.com/ibuuBQc.jpg" title="" >}}

The square hosts some of the oldest buildings existing in the today’s city: the Garrison Command (the former Generalate, a building existing in 1727), the former Chancellery of War (also existing in 1727, now forms the east wing of Old Town Hall), the Old Town Hall (1731 - 1734) and the Military Casino, built in 1744.

I found some interesting statues here, especially of a boy appearing to call someone.

### 7. PAY YOUR VISIT TO THE CETATE SYNAGOGUE

Though Cetate Synagogue is not situated in the city center, it is beautiful piece of architecture and should be visited. Located on Mărăşeşti Street in the Cetate district, it was built between 1863-1865 in Moorish style.

### 8. ADMIRE THE MILLENNIUM CHURCH

We stumble upon this church on our way to the Cetate Synagogue and boy, it is beautiful. Located in the Romanilor Square, close to the Traian Square, it is built in the Neo-Romanesque style by Lajos Ybl.

{{< figure src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3841/33703820156_bb4f0dbaab_b.jpg" title="" >}}

### 9. LOOK OUT FOR THE STREET ART/GRAFFITI

I was impressed by what I saw on the walls of Timisoara streets. Romanians are creative and artistic, visible from their random work on the walls.

### 10. HAVE FUN AT LULIUS MALL

The first thing we did after reaching Timisoara was visiting this mall because we needed a phone connection and wanted to grab something to eat. It is a big mall with many international brands. It is well organized and we ended up shopping here too as we were running out of clothes having been traveling for 4 months. Prices are reasonable. If you have been traveling for a long time and kinda tired with sightseeings, this mall is a good place to chill out and they got some good food.

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2868/33703409246_f44f57dc14_b.jpg" title="" >}}

We spent 2 nights in Timisoara and this city is super clean and I found the people helpful too. We could have easily spent a day or two more here, but we had some other plans.
