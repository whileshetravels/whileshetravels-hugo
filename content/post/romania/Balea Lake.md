Balea lake is a glacier lake close to Sibiu. It takes about an hour to get there by car. Situated at the height of 2,034 m in the Fagaras mountains, it is covered with snow for most part. In summer, you can drive to it via the Transfăgărășan road. We really wanted to drive through the Transfăgărășan road, but it is open only from July to September, unfortunately, due to heavy snow. If you happen to be here during that time, it should be in your list. It was featured in the British TV show, Top Gear and the host Jeremy Clarkson said that it’s the best road in the world.

If it is not accessible by car during the most part of the year, how can you reach it? Well, it’s easy. You take a cable car from the Bâlea Cascadă chalet. You can either drive to the Bâlea Cascadă chalet or take a bus, which is kinda expensive. We did not have a car in Sibiu and our Airbnb host, Dumitru, happened to be a certified guide too. We decided we will go on a day trip with him. We first started with the Balea Lake and then we visited some traditional Romanian villages of Marginimea Sibiului. Marginimea Sibiului is an area of 18 villages. We did not visit all the 18 villages obviously, but our guide showed us the interesting ones, which I would mention in my next post. Dumitru should be your number choice if you are looking for a guide in Sibiu. He is super friendly and it doesn’t feel you are with a guide. He made our trip to both Balea and the villages very meaningful. His rate is pretty decent too compared to other tours. He charged us 100 euros whereas other guides were asking for 160 euros for the same tour. You can contact him on his facebook page. If you decide to have a tour with him, do let me know. I have a 10% discount voucher which he gave us since we had a tour with him.
We started our tour at 10 AM, with Dumitru picking us up from our apartment, which he owns. We drove to the Balea Cascada. It was a beautiful drive. We got to see the countryside of Romania. After getting there, we immediately went to the cable car office. Cable car costs 30 Lei one way, which is about 7 euros. Kinda expensive in terms of how things are not expensive in Romania, but it’s worth it. We had to wait a bit for the cable car as there were not 10 people.

There were two more girls behind us. We got to know them while waiting. One of them was from California living in Israel, and the other one was from Malta. She was the first person from Malta I had ever met. Nice girl. We got on the cable car at 12 PM and OMG, what a spectacular view we had. The whole ground being covered with heavy snow and it felt we are approaching the white mountains. Our guide showed us the Transfăgărășan road below, which was layered with heavy snow, but we managed to see a small part of it.

It was about a 10 minute ride to the top. There was so much snow and obviously, we couldn’t see the Balea lake, but we have no regrets. It was just so beautiful. There is an ice hotel and an ice church. We did not go inside as it was April and ice was kinda melting. Our guide told us it might not be safe. We did have a look from the outside though, and they both looked interesting. Our guide also mentioned people come here in their fancy wedding dresses to get married. Crazy!

This is a perfect place for a lot of winter sports. We saw a lot of snowmobiling and skiing.

We wanted to up on the mountains, but it was not possible as we had no special gears, but it is possible to hike up if you proper shoes and hiking poles.

If you are in [Sibiu](http://whileshetravels.com/post/romania/sibiu/), and looking for half a day trip, you should definitely check out the Balea Lake.
