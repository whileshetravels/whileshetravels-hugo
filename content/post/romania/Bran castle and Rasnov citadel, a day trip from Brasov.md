When you are in Romania, and haven’t visited Bran castle aka Dracula’s castle, nobody would believe you have been to Romania. Romania is famous for its Dracula’s story and Vlad the impaler, who has been referred to as a vampire/Dracula due to his torture methods, but obviously, those are just legends, which became popular due to Bram Stoker’s novel, Dracula. Romania is famous for all the wrong reasons, it seems. This country has so much more to give and there are so many better things to see than Bran castle. Having said that, Bran castle should be on your list too. It’s just that don’t have high expectations from this castle.

On the other hand, if you visit Rasnov citadel, which is in the way to the Bran castle, you would be surprised how lovely it is.

### HOW TO GET TO BRAN CASTLE AND RASNOV CITADEL FROM BRASOV?

Bran castle is situated in Bran, 30 Km from Brasov. It is pretty easy to get there with a bus and it only takes about 40-45 minutes. It can be combined with a visit to Rasnov fortress, which is in between Brasov and Bran, and Rasnov is more impressive than Bran castle. So, in my opinion, you must stop at Rasnov, whether coming by bus or car. Buses to bran go through Rasnov. So, it is not even complicated. Buses/mini vans from Brasov are every half an hour or so. You can search the schedule [here](http://www.autogari.ro/). You get the bus from Brasov [autogara 2 (stadion)](https://www.google.ro/maps/dir/''/brasov+autogara+2/@45.6635092,25.5128946,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x40b35bbc983adcd3:0x4b0ee22a64e17b6!2m2!1d25.5829344!2d45.6635306). This bus station is half an hour walk from the city center or you can take bus 22/41 from the city center. We took a bus at 10:30 AM to Rasnov first. We bough the tickets from the driver. It took us half an hour to get there. It would be better if you ask someone to let you know when Rasnov comes, because you won’t really know when you are there. Once you get off, it is pretty simple. You can either walk to the fortress, which would take about 10-15 minutes or you can take a funicular, which runs frequently, and costs 12 lei round trip. We went with the second option. It took us just few minutes to reach the top. The view from the funicular is spectacular.

The entrance to the fortress is 12 lei. After exploring the fortress for an hour, we took the funicular back. We were kinda confused how to reach Bran castle from there. The lady at the ticket counter gave us the directions. You get the bus to Bran near Penny market and in front of the bus stop, you see a sign of “Rasnov” written in Hollywood style, up in the mountains. We were still not sure if we’re at the right bus stop, but an old man who didn’t even speak English,helped us, saying bus would arrive in his own way. The bus to Bran finally arrived and we were relieved. From Rasnov, it only takes about 15 minutes to reach Bran castle.

### RASNOV CITADEL

Rasnov is located in the town of Rasnov on a rocky hilltop in the Carpathian Mountains. The fortress was first mentioned in the year 1331. The fortress was built by Teutonic Knights as part of the defense system against various invasions. This was basically a place of refuge for the people and therefore, it had many schools, a chapel and other buildings which made it look more like a village.

We saw a well here at the citadel and found out it has an interesting story. The invaders managed to find out the source of water supply to the fortress and now the people needed a well for water in order to survive. According to legend, two Turkish prisoners were forced to dig a well through solid rock in the center of the fortress. They were promised their freedom once the well was finished. It took 17 years to finish this digging and God knows what happened to those prisoners.

I really liked the citadel. Set beautifully among the Carpathian mountains, it has massive fortified walls, and plenty of perfect lookout spots. There is not a lot to do here except for admiring the views from the top, which I loved. You get to see the entire towns below as well the impressive forests that surround this amazing citadel.

There are quite a few cheesy souvenir shops, but that’s alright. It’s still fun to walk around and imagine what life was like back in the day.

### BRAN CASTLE

Bran castle made famous by the myth created around Bram Stocker’s Dracula is rather a simple castle. I visited Peles castle today, and that’s what we call a luxurious elegant castle. Nevertheless, as I mentioned earlier, Bran castle is something you have to visit when in Romania. I have to say this it does look impressive from the outside. It gives you that eerie feeling maybe because of its location.

{{< figure src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2806/33086209853_e698de4007_b.jpg" title="" >}}

The first documented mentioning of Bran Castle is the letter written in 1377 by the Hungarian Ludovic I D’Anjou, giving the Saxon inhabitants of Brasov the privilege to build a stone castle at their own expenses. The castle was also used against the Ottomans and Tartars’ invasion, coming from Wallachia through Rucar Pass. From 1920 to 1957 Bran served as royal residence within the kingdom of Romania.

{{< figure src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3951/33086175403_ef3b21657e_b.jpg" title="" >}}

The castle is now a museum open to tourists, displaying art and furniture collected by Queen Marie.

The castle doesn’t have anything to do with Vlad the impaler. Vlad Tepes or Vlad Dracula was a son of Vlad II Dracul. He was a three-time Voivode of Wallachia, ruling mainly from 1456 to 1462. Dracul used to mean dragon at that time, but now even in Romania, it means devil.

{{< figure src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3942/33086174223_75d6dcfe3c_b.jpg" title="Hello Dracula!" >}}

Vlad Tepes is a national hero in Romania as he fought against Ottomans though he used some crazy brutal techniques to torture his enemies. He used to impale them. Hence, he is called the impaler or Tepes. There are legends that he even used to drink his enemies’ blood and hence he was a vampire. Bram Stoker, an Irish writer, whose book Dracula is mistakenly thought to be based on Vlad Tepes and Bran castle to as the home of the title character.

It is a nice castle, but a little bit too touristy. Thanks to Vlad III Impaler, the ticket prices are higher than justified. We visited all rooms in about an hour. I am sure everyone knows there is no Dracula here, but it’s an interesting story and the souvenir markets outside the castle is beautiful.

We wanted to take the bus back back to Brasov at 2:40 PM, but it arrived early at 2:30 PM. There is a schedule posted but don’t rely a lot on it.
