Bran castle is interesting and all thanks to Bram Stoker and Vlad the impaler, but honestly it is a rather simple castle and one not so impressive. Many people come out from there disappointed. If you really wanna see a castle at a grand level near Brasov, you should head to a town of Sinaia and walk to the Peles castle. It is one of the most picturesque and stylish castles in Europe, with extremely well-preserved architecture, details and furniture. It kind of reminded me of the Palace of Versailles in France from the inside, kind of like a mini Versailles. So, you can imagine how beautiful it is.

### HISTORY OF PELES CASTLE

Peles castle is a German Neo-Renaissance castle at the foot of the Bucegi Mountains. Built between 1873 and 1914, it was commissioned by King Carol of Romania under whose reign the country gained its independence. The castle served as the summer residence of the royal family until 1947.
HOW TO REACH PELES CASTLE FROM BRASOV

The easiest way to reach Peles is by train from Brasov. We took a train from Brasov train station to Sinaia at 1:03 PM and reached Sinaia at 2:10 PM. From Sinaia train station, it is an uphill walk for about 25 minutes. You can get a taxi if you are not up for walking. You will see the sign for the castle everywhere. So, getting to the castle shouldn’t be a problem. During summer (May 15 to September 15), it is closed on Mondays, and in winter (16 September to 14 May), it is closed both Mondays and Tuesdays. We visited in April and it was not so crowded, but in summer time, you will have to wait a while to get inside. Yes, it is one of the top tourist destinations in Romania.
ENTRANCE FEE

This castle costs 30 Lei for adults for the ground floor, which includes a guide in Romanian/English/ French/Spanish/Italian. We opted out just for ground floor. There is an option to visit the second floor as well and that costs 60 Lei. Also, you gotta pay for taking pictures, which is 35 Lei. And please don’t post those pictures anywhere. You will be punished by law in force. Therefore, I won’t be positing any inside pictures.

### INSIDE THE PELES CASTLE

The castle has about 170 rooms, many with dedicated themes from world cultures. We saw rooms designed in French, Moorish, Turkish, Florentine, etc. styles. Our guide was a well informed man who gave a brief history about some of the important rooms though it was kind of difficult to hear him as there were a lot of other people too in the same room. The castle has one of the finest art collections in Eastern and Central Europe including different glasswares, paintings, furnitures, musical instruments, weapons and armors, ceramics, stained glass, etc.

The only thing which I did not like was there was no wandering around on your own in the castle. You have to follow your guide and hence 50 other people all the time and when the tour is over, you have to exit. I understand they are trying to preserve the castle, but come on. They can make the service a little better, I believe. But for the castle itself, it is 10/10. Truly mesmerizing. I am very tempted to post the interior pictures, but I would follow the rules. I am a good girl.

Next to the Peles castle, there is another castle called Pelisor Castle. We did not go inside the castle. From the outside, it looked simple yet beautiful. It has 99 rooms and most of the rooms were decorated by the Queen Marie.
