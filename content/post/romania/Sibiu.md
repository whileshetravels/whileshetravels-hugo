Sibiu was our second destination in Romania, first being Timisoara. Both the cities are so distinct from each other. Where Timisoara is a big city by the standard of Romania, Sibiu is more like a town, to be more precise, a German town, with a total population of 147,245. Sibiu is located in Transylvania region, which is the most interesting part of Romania. It was one of the seven cities in Transylvania with German settlers. It was only after World War 2 that ethnic Germans migrated to Germany and Austria, and the current President of Romania happens to be from a German family in Sibiu. Sibiu was designated as the European Cultural Capital in 2007 and it truly deserves it. In 2007, it hosted 2000 events, very diverse in type: performing arts, film, photo, architecture, visual arts, literature, music, heritage, conferences. Its historical center takes you back to the medieval times and makes you forget all about your busy boring city life.

TOP THINGS TO SEE IN SIBIU

### 1. BIG SQUARE (PIATA MARE)

This is my favorite place in Sibiu, hands down. Big square is really big and wonderful and I loved strolling around here. Situated in the heart of the old town, your trip to Sibiu is incomplete without visiting this square.

We stayed in Sibiu for 6 nights and we used to take a walk around this square almost everyday. All the important landmarks of Sibiu are situated here, and that’s what makes this place so beautiful. Also, you can do both bird and people watching while enjoying your ice cream or coffee.

### 2. THE COUNCIL TOWER

The Council Tower is one of the most famous monuments in Sibiu situated in the old town close to the Big Square. The name comes from the fact that it is situated in the immediate close to the building which once hosted the City Hall of Sibiu. Even though it does not look something extraordinary from the outside, you have to climb up those crazy stairs to see what it stores.

The entrance fee is only 2 Lei which is like 0.5 euros. You can find rooms on your way up with exhibitions and one of them has a clock working since 1494. The best time to visit is during the sunset when the old buildings are soaked in the orange glow of the sun.

### 3. LUTHERAN EVANGELICAL CATHEDRAL & TOWER

Lutheran Evangelical Cathedral is one of the most impressive cathedrals in Romania, situated in the old town of Sibiu. It was raised in the 14th century on the location of an old Roman church dating from the 12th century.

The building is dominated by the seven level tower with the four towers on the corners, a mark showing that the city had the right of condemnation.

Climbing the tower is quite interesting and should be done only if you are fit enough, but once you do it, the view from the top is amazing. It costs 7 lei if i remember correctly.

### 4. THE LIAR’S BRIDGE

Before visiting the Bridge of Lies, just beware that if you tell a lie on this bridge, it will collapse. Just kidding. It is one of the many legends associated with this small picturesque bridge made of iron, one of the first in Europe, and situated in the old town, connecting the upper town with the lower town. It was built in 1859.

A great spot to take some pictures as it is a symbol of Sibiu.

### 5. ASTRA NATIONAL MUSEUM COMPLEX

If you are interested in Romanian history and traditions, Astra National Museum Complex should definitely be on your list when visiting Sibiu. It is the largest open air museum in Romania exhibiting historic houses from the different regions in Romania.

The ASTRA Museum is situated in the Dumbrava Forest, at a distance of 4 kilometers from the city. You can take bus 13 (runs every half an hour) from the old town and get off at the last stop, which is the museum. You have to buy the bus ticket from a kiosk and the driver.

### 6. THE “HOLY TRINITY” METROPOLITAN CATHEDRAL

The Holy Trinity Cathedral in Sibiu is a beautiful cathedral, which is the seat of the Romanian Orthodox Archbishop of Sibiu and Metropolitan of Transylvania. It was built in the style of a Byzantine basilica while also having some elements of Baroque and Transylvanian church architecture.

The idea of building an orthodox cathedral in Sibiu belonged to bishop Andrei Şaguna as early as 1857, the actual building starting only in 1902.

### 7. BISERICA ROMANO CATHOLIC CHURCH

Situated in the big square, you can stop here for a few minutes to admire the facade and also the richly decorated interior. Though it is not something special from outside, it surely deserves a visit for its excellent stained glass windows and richly decorated ceiling paintings and oh, it’s absolutely free.

### 8. BLACK WALL BY THE NATIONAL THEATER

The Black Wall is a special project of artist Dan Perjovschi and if you like political satire, you must check this out. It reminded me of the East Side Gallery in Berlin. The drawings are centered on the ideas of freedom, civility, and democracy.

We spent a total of 6 nights in Sibiu, and some might say it was too much, but honestly, we felt it was too little. There are a lot of things to do in the surroundings of Sibiu too. We went to Balea lake and also visited some of the Romanian and Saxony villages close to Sibiu. You can also go to Paltinis resort, which is only 32 Km North-West from Sibiu. Paltinis is the highest (1440 m altitude), and the oldest resort in Romania.
