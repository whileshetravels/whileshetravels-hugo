Situated near the silver Gate of the Diocletian’s Palace, Green market which is also called Pazar, is one of the most happening places of Split, and a great place to meet some locals. It is like a farmer’s market on a big level.

Currently in Split, I often visit this market and during morning, it is so lively. Today I bought dried figs and a big ass red capsicum.

You can buy fresh fruits, vegetables, olive oil, honey, cheese, flowers, dry fruits, clothes, DVDs, books, and all sort of stuff.

Even if you do not have to buy anything, you should definitely walk around this market and get soaked in the spirit of locals. You never know you might end up with a good souvenir.

Yes, there are a couple of supermarkets close to this market, but come one, it is always more fun to buy fresh products from locals, and this way you are also supporting them. All the vendors and there are many old women here are so friendly. They try their best to interact with you despite the language barrier.
Green market is open everyday from morning to evening, but the best time is to go early. I am planning to go tomorrow morning. Let’s see what I end up buying.
