Having rented a car for two days in Split, we went to Plitvice lakes national park on day 1 and on day 2, we wanted to spend sometime in Sibenik before driving through the coast to Primosten. Sibenik is a town situated in the middle of the Adriatic coast. It is where Krka flows into the Adriatic sea. There are a lot of attractions here but rather than going into the main town, we chose to visit St Anthony’s channel.

St Anthony’s channel being part of the area channel port, is about 2000 meters long. It provides a breathtaking view of Šibenik, Šibenik archipelago and the Fortress of St. Nicholas. It is perfect for walking, running, hiking, or just strolling around.

There is a 4.4 Km long trail connecting area of the bay Panikovac to the island Školjić in front of St.  Nicholas Fortress. We had put St. Nicholas fortress in your google map and we had no trouble finding it. We parked our car in one of the parking spots and walked to the fortress first.

Walking inside the fortress was at your own risk and we chose not to take this risk this time. We did some people going in though.

St Nicholas Fortress was built in the mid16th century to prevent Turkish empire from conquering Sibenik. After covering the fortress, we started the hike to the view point which was at the top. It was a fairly easy hike.

It took us about an hour to get on top. You could see how beautiful the city of Sibenik is.

There is another view point too which is further up. We went there too and amazing views again of both Sibenik and Sibenik archipelago. I think we were the only tourists there though there were many locals hiking or being out with their kids as there is a children’s playground at the beginning of the trail.

After coming down, we drove to [Primosten](http://whileshetravels.com/post/croatia/sibenik-to-primosten-drive/) and it is a really beautiful drive along the coast, and that would be my next post.
