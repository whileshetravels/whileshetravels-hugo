Solin is a town situated northeast of Split on the Adriatic sea and the river Jadro. Being the birthplace of emperor Diocletian, it was important both politically and religiously. It was previously called Salona and it was the capital of the Roman province of Dalmatia. You can imagine its importance for the Roman empire. If you happen to be interested in archaeology or like history, this is a place you must visit. It is a hidden gem with spectacular Roman ruins.

### HOW TO REACH SOLIN FROM SPLIT:

We took bus #1 from HNK (Split National theater). It runs every half an hour. We took the bus at 11:50 AM. You can also take bus #16 or #22 from the same spot, HNK. It took us about 15-20 minutes to reach. Ask your driver to drop you off by the ruins entrance, which is by Konzum supermarket. We did have trouble finding the entrance but google map helped. We did not find any signpost directing to the ruins. So, asking the driver or having google map would be your best option.
EXPLORING THE ROMAN RUINS

I loved this site. It is open and you can just walk anywhere and it would take you back to the ancient times.

There are information boards written in both Croatian and English and that helped us a lot getting a sense of what we were seeing.

First, we came across the remains of the Basilica and the cemetery of Manastirine, followed by an old garden with a very fine pagoda of vines stretching away to a very fine view of the surrounding countryside.

Walking further down the hill, we passed through the numerous old elements of the city including the five bridges, before making to the remains of the amphitheater built in 2nd century A.D., which was supposed to hold about 17,000 spectators for the gladiators fights.

This amphitheater is also the place where the first Christian martyrs lost their lives.

At first, we were hesitant going here but this is a great spot to be lost in the history of the Roman empire though I feel they can do a better job in preserving the ruins and making it more useful for the tourists. This way Solin can get more visitors.
