Diocletian’s Palace is one of the best preserved monuments of the Roman architecture in the world. Many people would say, “Split = Dioclentian’s Palace” though Split is much more than that. Nevertheless, being in Split, you have to visit this place and being in Split for 20 days, we used to pass this palace almost everyday and I would click a picture or two every damn time. This palace has been destroyed for most part, but the ruins remain and its ruins are wonderful too. So, you can wonder how the actual palace would be like.

### HISTORY OF THE DIOCLETIAN’S PALACE

Diocletian’s Palace was built by the Roman emperor Diocletian in the turn of the 4th century AD in the preparation of his retirement. No, he wasn’t old or anything. I guess he just wanted to enjoy his life and therefore, he gave his throne voluntarily. This palace was built both for the personal use of the emperor and for the military purposes. At present, it is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

### EXPLORING THE PALACE

The palace is rectangular in shape with 4 large towers at the corner and each of the tower has its own door. The Golden Gate, which could only be used by the Emperor and his family was rectangular in shape built with double doors (a kind of military strategy). Today, close to the Golden Gate, there is a large statue of Grgur Ninski, which is a work of a great Croatian sculptor Ivan Meštrović.

The Silver Gate, less modest in decorations than the Golden gate was used to enter the palace from the east towards the west through the main street, decumanus.

There are two more gates, the Iron Gate on the west and the Brass Gate, which unlike other gates faces the Adriatic sea. You can also enter the basement from the Brass Gate.

You can’t miss the Peristyle, which is a monumental court on the crossroad of the two main roads of the Palace. You may call it the center of Split This is where the Emperor would appear and people would kneel down or try to kiss his expensive cloak or have one look at him.

The Peristyle also has a 3500 year old sphinx brought from Egypt for the Emperor. That man got some artistic taste. Having passed this several times, I never got myself a picture here as I was waiting for the last day, I guess, I don’t know why and today, it happened to have some kind of shooting going on for a Croatian movie/drama I am not sure.

We visited the bell tower of the Cathedral of Saint Dominus, which costed us 20 kunas/person.

The beginning steps are a little challenging with 2 steps made equal to 1 step, but it can be done easily. In summer, it can be a problem with s many people. The view of Split from the top is splendid. I would highly recommend climbing up those steps.

We also visited the basement of this beautiful palace. It is not free, but it does not cost much. The ticket price is 42 kunas/person.

This is where they kept the dragons in season 4 of GOT. Game of Thrones fans would understand. The basement is nothing special honestly. It can be reached from the Brass Gate from the waterfront side or by the steps leading from the Peristyle.

The basement helped the palace to be above the sea level, so that the big porch of the southern facade could be exposed to the sun and summer breeze.

When the city of Split started to get developed, this basement became a place to dump garbage just like most of the basements. At present, it is used as a site for concerts, exhibitions, theater performances, trade fairs, etc. and a must see thing if you are in Split, which you should if you visit Croatia.
