If you are a sea food lover, you have to visit Split, Croatia. We stayed in Split for 20 days, and though we cooked at home too, we tried out many restaurants especially the ones in the Old Town. I found most of the restaurants clean with excellent customer service and yes, everyone speaks in English in Split, it seems. We found the prices of our dishes pretty reasonable too and portion was always good..neither too big nor too small. Make sure you visit Luka for ice creams and cakes. That small store never disappointed us.
