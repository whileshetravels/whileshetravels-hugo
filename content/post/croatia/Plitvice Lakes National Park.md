Plitvice Lakes National Park situated in the Lika county, which is like the middle of Croatia, is one of the most visited sights in Croatia with about 1 million visitors each year, and for good reasons. It is a UNESCO World Heritage site and the largest park in Croatia. I don’t know how it is in summer, but in winter it is too damn beautiful. And we knew we have to visit this place when we were planning to stay in Croatia.

### ABOUT THE PLITVICE LAKES

The name Plitvice originates from a Croatian word, “Plitvak” which means shallow. Plitivice is like a shallow basin filled with water. As the name suggests, this national park has beautiful lakes (upper lakes and lower lakes) in a cascade form resulting from various small rivers and subterranean karst rivers. It also has caves and waterfalls. Water color ranges from blue to green to azure.

### HOW TO REACH PLITVICE FROM SPLIT:

We were thinking to spend a night here before but decided not to after finding out that in winter, upper lakes are closed and also, the park closes at 4:00 PM. It is not possible to do a day trip from Split to Plitvice using the public transportation. We agreed on renting a car and what a wise decision that was. It takes about 3 hours to reach Plitvice from Split using the highway A1 Zagreb-Split.

We left early morning around 9 AM and reached by 12 PM. The moment we hit the park area, the weather changed completely. There was a lot of snow and it got chilly. Nonetheless, a wonderful drive.

If you are not up for renting a car, you can take one of the private buses. You can find information about the schedule [here](http://www.buscroatia.com/split-plitvice/). There are accommodations inside the park and also around the park.

### EXPLORING THE PARK

There are two entrances to this park, entrance 1 and entrance 2 and in winter, only entrance 1 is open. There are 8 hiking trails here, and in winter you can only do one of them, which is trail A starting and ending at entrance 1.

With limited time that was our best option anyway. Also, in summer, both train and boat run, which is included in your ticket price. After purchasing our tickets, we started our hike. Okayyyy, so it was too slippery and we were in our running shoes. I was scared honestly, and were being careful to such an extent that I would stop moving completely.

There were a good amount of people but nothing in comparison to the number of people during summer. I have read it is a mad house at that time of the year and though the park is super pretty, people are unable to enjoy or take pictures. We did not have any of that issue. Most of the things were frozen, and that just added to the beauty of the park. After some initial slips here and there, it got better.

Trail A is an easy hike with many rewarding views. We were surrounded with water eveyrwhere and the flow of water was full of speed. We covered the lower lakes first and though there were signs like going further away is at your own risk, everyone went anyway. That risk was worth taking I guess.

We also covered the great waterfalls and Kozjaka bridge. In summer, it is possible to do sailing on lake Kozjaka.

It took us about 3 hours to explore the park and we took a ton of pictures in between.

I wish the upper lakes and other parts of the lake were open, but that’s okay. It would motivate me to come back to this amazing park in summer and from the pictures, it appears it would be a totally different park at that time of the year.
