Marjan hill situated on the peninsula of Split is the soul of the city. Covered in a dense mediterranean Pine forest and surrounded by the sea and the city, it makes a great escape place from the hustle and bustle of the center.

There are many things to do here. There is a beach called Bene here, where you could swim in summer. There are 12 historical monuments including the church of St Nicholas. You can find the Split zoo here too, but we were interested in hiking the Marjan park forest and enjoy the panoramic view of Split.
HOW TO REACH MARJAN HILL

You can start the hike to Marjan directly from the waterfront/Riva of Split and climb 819 steps to reach the view point Telegrin, but we did not about this route. We took bus #12 to Bene beach and walked up to the hill. At first we were not sure if weâ€™re on the right path, but we had a map of Marjan, which helped us a great deal.

It took us about 45 minutes to reach the top where we saw a Croatian flag flying over the city. The view of Split from the top was splendid and it was worth getting up early morning on Sunday.

We came back from a different route. We ended up on the waterfront and it took us only 30 minutes to get down.

When you are done doing all the touristy things in Split, Marjan Hill would provide you some peace and rest for sure.
