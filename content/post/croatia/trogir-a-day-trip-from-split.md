Trogir is a beautiful sea side town along the coast of the Adriatic sea. Its center is listed as the UNESCO World heritage site. And if you are in Split for few days, this should definitely be on your list.

HISTORY OF TROGIR

Trogir, whose name is derived from the Greek word “Tragos” meaning male goat, was founded by the Greeks in about 3rd BC. When the Romans took over, Trogir lost its importance due to the nearby city Salona, which became the capital of the Roman province on the Dalmatian coast. When Salona was destroyed, people escaped to Trogir and Trogir started to flourish once again. After this, Trogir had been ruled by various rulers including the Croatians, the Hungarians, the Venetians, the Austrians and the French. After world war 1, it became a part of the common state of South Slavic nations, later of Yugoslavia and now it belongs to Croatia.
HOW TO REACH TROGIR FROM SPLIT BY BUS

It is very easy to reach Trogir from Split using bus #37. It is also accessible by ferry. We got the timetable of bus 37 (Split to Trogir) and bus 37 (Trogir to Split) easily, but I had some difficulty finding the bus stop.

Google map does not show any information about buses here for reasons I am not aware of. After doing some research, I found out that bus 37 starts from the bus station called Sukoisan, which is a sub urban bus station, located directly by the main street, Domovinskog rata. It drops off right by the center of Trogir. It is about an hour ride from Split Sukoisan bus station. We caught the bus at 10:50 AM and reached Trogir by 12 PM.
THINGS TO DO IN TROGIR

Trogir is one of those towns you do not need to plan anything ahead of time. Just wandering around the town, walking through narrow cobbled stone streets, getting to know the history of many ancient historical buildings, popping in one of the many boutiques would leave you all relaxed.

We wanted to go inside the St. Lawrence cathedral after hearing it is one of the best in Croatia, but it had just closed when we reached at 12.

We asked one of the tourist agencies about the cathedral opening hours, and the man there was not sure, but he gave us the tourist map with everything labeled and we used it to explore Trogir. You can get one from the tourist office situated in the city center.

The St. Sebastian’s Church is a Renaissance building built in 1476 as an offering given by the citizens of Trogir when the city got rid of the plague.

The town Loggia was used as a public gathering place. It was also used for making official announcements and for things like signing contacts.

The above fortress was built to protect the sea channel and Trogir after Trogir became part of the Republic of Venice. Pretty cool. Though we wanted to go inside, it was not possible. Eveything was locked.

We decided to grab lunch and there were so many restaurants to choose from. We wanted to sit outside facing the sea and we got the perfect place called Pizzeria Mirkec.

Our waiter was super friendly. We had mushroom soup fried squid with tartar sauce and french fries. So delicious.

After filling ourselves, we just walked around the sea. We still had half an hour to catch the bus, which was at 2 PM, and we were close to the bus stop.

Trogir is a small enchanting medieval town and it is worth a stop. We were here for a couple of hours and able to see many historical sights.
