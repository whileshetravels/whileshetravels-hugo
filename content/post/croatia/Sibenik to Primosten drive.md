We loved the drive along the Pacific highway in California and wanted to do something similar in Croatia too. The stage was set. We had a rented car, there was the Adriatic sea, and our destination was Primosten, a town situated on the Adriatic coast between Sibenik and Trogir.

We spent our Sunday morning at [St Anthony’s channel in Sibenik](http://whileshetravels.com/post/croatia/st-anthonys-channel-in-sibenik/), hiking with locals, and after finishing the hike, we were ready to go to Primosten. Honestly, we were more excited for  the drive and the beautiful views rather than the actual destination. We were not disappointed at all. We came across many beaches and coves with the water color being somewhere between blue and green. My words won’t to justice to what I experiences. The picture below might help.

We stopped by at one of the beaches and there was nobody at all. My husband aka the driver (I was just enjoying the view) wanted to dip in the water, but it was cold. We were satisfied with just wetting our feet.

When we reached Primosten, we were super hungry and wanted have lunch, but guess what?Everything was closed. :( Turns out Primosten is a tourist town and things are open only during summer. We wandered around here and there for sometime before leaving for Split, where we’re staying.
